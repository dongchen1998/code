35963473,Safety evaluation of Neurospora crassa mycoprotein for use as a novel meat alternative and enhancer.,"Cultivation of filamentous fungi to produce sustainable, nutrient rich meat replacements has recently attracted significant commercial and research interest. Here, we report evidence for the safety and nutritional value of Neurospora crassa mycoprotein, a whole mycelium food ingredient produced by fermentation and minimal downstream processing. N. crassa has a long history of human use in fermented foods and in molecular biology research. A survey of studies that used N. crassa in animal feed revealed no adverse effects to the health of the animals. Furthermore, a review of the literature found no reports of confirmed allergenicity or toxicity in humans involving N. crassa. Genomic toxigenicity analysis and in vitro testing did not identify any toxins in N. crassa mycoprotein. Two independent genomic allergenicity studies did not identify proteins that would be considered a particular risk for allergenic potential. Furthermore, nutritional analysis demonstrated that N. crassa mycoprotein is a good source of complete protein and is rich in fiber, potassium, and iron. Taken together, the presented data and the history of human use without evidence of human or animal harm indicate that foods containing N. crassa can generally be regarded as safe.","['Food safety', 'Meat alternative', 'Mycoprotein', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Sustainability']",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,USA.

34265094,Revisiting the Neurospora crassa mitochondrial genome.,"The mitochondrial genome of Neurospora crassa has been less studied than its nuclear counterpart, yet it holds great potential for understanding the diversity and evolution of this important fungus. Here we describe a new mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) complete sequence of a N. crassa wild type strain. The genome with 64 839 bp revealed 21 protein-coding genes and several hypothetical open reading frames with no significant homology to any described gene. Five large repetitive regions were identified across the genome, including partial or complete genes. The largest repeated region holds a partial nd2 section that was also detected in Neurospora intermedia, suggesting a rearrangement that occurred before the N. crassa speciation. Interestingly, N. crassa has a palindrome adjacent to the partial nd2 repeated region possibly related to the genomic rearrangement, which is absent in N. intermedia. Finally, we compared the sequences of the three available N. crassa complete mtDNAs and found low levels of intraspecific variability. Most differences among strains were due to small indels in noncoding regions. The revisiting of the N. crassa mtDNA forms the basis for future studies on mitochondrial genome organization and variability.","['DNA polymorphism', 'fungi', 'genomic rearrangements', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'repeats']",Letters in applied microbiology,Portugal,2021 Oct
31172300,Conidiation in Neurospora crassa: vegetative reproduction by a model fungus.,"Asexual development, conidiation, in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a simple developmental process that starts with the growth of aerial hyphae. Then, the formation of constrictions and subsequent maturation gives rise to the mature conidia that are easily dispersed by air currents. Conidiation is regulated by environmental factors such as light, aeration and nutrient limitation, and by the circadian clock. Different regulatory proteins acting at different stages of conidiation have been described. The role of transcription factors such as FL, and components of signal transduction pathways such as the cAMP phosphodiesterase ACON-2 suggest a complex interplay between differential transcription and signal transduction pathways. Comparisons between the molecular basis of conidiation in N. crassa and other filamentous fungi will help to identify common regulatory elements.","['Asexual development', 'Conidiation', 'Neurospora', 'Sporulation']",International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,Germany. c.ruger-herreros@zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de,2020 Jan
32305463,Phosphorylation Timers in the Neurospora crassa Circadian Clock.,"Circadian clocks are self-sustained oscillators that orchestrate metabolism and physiology in synchrony with the 24-hâ€¯day-night cycle. They are temperature compensated over a wide range and entrained by daily recurring environmental cues. Eukaryotic circadian clocks are governed by cell-based transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs). The core components of the TTFLs are largely known and their molecular interactions in many cases well established. Although the core clock components are not or only partly conserved, the molecular wiring of TTFLs is rather similar across kingdoms and phylae. In all known systems, circadian timing relies critically on casein kinase 1 (CK1) and CK1-dependent hyperphosphorylation of core clock proteins, in particular of negative elements of the TTFLs. Yet, we lack concepts as to how phosphorylation by CK1a and other kinases relates to timekeeping on the molecular level. Here we summarize what is known about phosphorylation of core components of the circadian clock of Neurospora crassa and speculate about the molecular basis of circadian timekeeping by hyperphosphorylation of intrinsically disordered regions in clock proteins.","['Neurospora crassa', 'casein kinase 1', 'circadian clock', 'intrinsically disordered proteins', 'phosphorylation']",Journal of molecular biology,Germany,2020 May 29
25480699,Neurospora crassa: looking back and looking forward at a model microbe.,"Investigation of the red bread mold that contaminated French bakeries nearly two centuries ago has led to a wealth of discoveries that have impacted our understanding of genetic, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms in microbes, from Mendelian genetics and the gene-enzyme relationship to circadian rhythm and plant cell wall degradation. Early Neurospora research focused on elucidating mechanisms of genetic recombination and gene action and later progressed to addressing complex biological questions of eukaryotic microbes. Here we review the evolution of the filamentous fungus Neurospora as a model microbe over the past century. We discuss the origins of Neurospora as a model microbe, the immediate scientific impacts from work in this filamentous fungus, and how the introduction of other model organisms (i.e., Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) redirected the focus of Neurospora research. Neurospora has and continues to inform our understanding of a myriad of basic scientific concepts and now has the opportunity to forge into the applied biosciences and biotechnology.","['Fungal Genetics Stock Center', 'Neurospora crassa', 'biochemical mutants', 'biotechnology', 'circadian rhythm', 'gene silencing', 'genetics', 'heterokaryosis', 'photobiology', 'population']",American journal of botany,California USA,2014 Dec
35881300,Neurospora crassa is a potential source of anti-cancer agents against breast cancer.,"Fungi are an excellent source of pharmaceuticals including anti-tumor agents. Neurospora crassa generates metabolites with diverse structural classes, however, its potential as an anti-tumor agent source has not been explored. The purpose of this study aimed to investigate the potential of Neurospora crassa mixture against breast cancer. The in vitro T-47D and MDA-MB-231 experiments showed that N. crassa mixture at the concentrations of both 1.7 and 0.85 microg/ml significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and 3D spheroid formation. However, the inhibition rates of MCF-10A ranged 10-20% at concentrations of 0.85 and 1.7 microg/ml. The mixture at the concentration of 0.85 microg/ml could significantly downregulate the expressions of transcription factors of E2F1 and E2F3, cancer stem cell-related genes of LIN28, HIWI, and CD133, and onco-lncRNA HOTAIR, and increase CASP3 activity in either T-47D or MDA-MD-231 breast cancer cell lines. In vivo breast cancer C3H mouse model results showed that N. crassa mixture significantly inhibited tumor growth. These findings suggest that N. crassa contains an antitumor component(s) against breast cancer invasiveness, which may inhibit the self-renewal and differentiation of breast cancer stem cells possibly by downregulating cancer stem cell-associated and/or transcription factor genes and oncogenes, and promoting apoptosis.","['3D spheroid', 'Breast cancer', 'Cancer stem cells', 'Gene expression', 'Neurospora crassa']","Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",People's Republic of China,2022 Nov
24086046,"Neurospora crassa, a model system for epigenetics research.","The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has provided a rich source of knowledge on epigenetic phenomena that would have been difficult or impossible to gain from other systems. Neurospora sports features found in higher eukaryotes but absent in both budding and fission yeast, including DNA methylation and H3K27 methylation, and also has distinct RNA interference (RNAi)-based silencing mechanisms operating in mitotic and meiotic cells. This has provided an unexpected wealth of information on gene silencing systems. One silencing mechanism, named repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), has both epigenetic and genetic aspects and provided the first example of a homology-based genome defense system. A second silencing mechanism, named quelling, is an RNAi-based mechanism that results in silencing of transgenes and their native homologs. A third, named meiotic silencing, is also RNAi-based but is distinct from quelling in its time of action, targets, and apparent purpose.",?,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,Texas 77843-3258,2013 Oct 1
35616476,Targeted Metabolomics Using LC-MS in Neurospora crassa.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has historically been a model for understanding the relationship between genes and metabolism-auxotrophic mutants of N. crassa were used by Beadle and Tatum to develop the one-gene-one-enzyme hypothesis for which they earned the Nobel Prize in 1958. In the ensuing decades, several techniques have been developed for the systematic analysis of metabolites in N. crassa and other fungi. Untargeted and targeted approaches have been used, with a focus on secondary metabolites over primary metabolism. Here, we describe a pipeline for sample preparation, metabolite extraction, Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), and data analysis that can be used for targeted metabolomics of primary metabolites in N. crassa. Liquid cultures are grown with shaking in a defined minimal medium and then collected using filtration. Samples are lyophilized for 2 days at -80 degrees C, pulverized, and mixed with a solution to extract polar metabolites. The metabolites are separated and identified using LC-MS, with downstream analysis using Skyline interpretive software. Relative levels of hundreds of metabolites can be detected and compared across strains. (c) 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

25239547,Neurospora crassa as a model organism to explore the interconnected network of the cell cycle and the circadian clock.,"Budding and fission yeast pioneered uncovering molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic cell division cycles. However, they do not possess canonical circadian clock machinery that regulates physiological processes with a period of about 24h. On the other hand, Neurospora crassa played a critical role in elucidating molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms, but have not been utilized frequently for cell cycle studies. Recent findings demonstrate that there exists a conserved coupling between the cell cycle and the circadian clock from N.crassa to Mus musculus, which poses Neurospora as an ideal model organism to investigate molecular mechanisms and emerging behavior of the coupled network of the cell cycle and circadian rhythms. In this review, we briefly describe generic eukaryotic cell cycle regulation focusing on G1/S and G2/M transitions, and highlight that these transitions may be targeted for the circadian clock to influence timing of cell division cycles.","['Cell cycle', 'Circadian clock', 'Model organisms', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Oscillations']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,United States,2014 Oct
26340439,Cell fusion in Neurospora crassa.,"In recent years, the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has advanced as a model organism for studying eukaryotic cell-cell communication and fusion. Cell merger in this fungus employs an unusual mode of communication, in which the fusion partners appear to switch between signal sending and receiving. Many molecular factors mediating this intriguing mechanism and the subsequent membrane merger have been identified. It has become apparent that conserved factors, such as MAP kinases, NADPH oxidases and the STRIPAK complex, together with fungal specific proteins are wired into an intricate signaling network. Here, we will present an overview of recent findings on the molecular mechanism mediating fusion in N. crassa and will discuss the current working model.",?,Current opinion in microbiology,Germany,2015 Dec
33159072,Establishment of Neurospora crassa as a model organism for fungal virology.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is used as a model organism for genetics, developmental biology and molecular biology. Remarkably, it is not known to host or to be susceptible to infection with any viruses. Here, we identify diverse RNA viruses in N. crassa and other Neurospora species, and show that N. crassa supports the replication of these viruses as well as some viruses from other fungi. Several encapsidated double-stranded RNA viruses and capsid-less positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses can be experimentally introduced into N. crassa protoplasts or spheroplasts. This allowed us to examine viral replication and RNAi-mediated antiviral responses in this organism. We show that viral infection upregulates the transcription of RNAi components, and that Dicer proteins (DCL-1, DCL-2) and an Argonaute (QDE-2) participate in suppression of viral replication. Our study thus establishes N. crassa as a model system for the study of host-virus interactions.",?,Nature communications,Japan,2020 Nov 6
32270506,Quantification of Neurospora crassa mitochondrial DNA using quantitative real-time PCR.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a popular model organism used in a wide range of biochemical and genetic studies and vastly used in mitochondrial research. Despite the relevance of mitochondria in N. crassa biology, no method for quantification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is currently available. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a powerful tool, with a wide range of applications, and has been used for the quantification of nucleic acids in humans and a few other species. Here we present a new qPCR assay for relative quantification of N. crassa mtDNA. Three sets of qPCR primers targeting different regions of the mitochondrial genome were tested for mtDNA quantification. The qPCR was successfully validated in N. crassa strains from different geographical locations, representing the vast genetic diversity of this species, and knockout mutant strains. Moreover the assay proved to be efficient in templates with varied amounts of mitochondria, obtained through different DNA extraction methods. The qPCR performed well in all tested samples revealing a higher amount of mtDNA than nuclear DNA in all cases. This technique will facilitate the characterization of mtDNA of N. crassa in future studies and can be used as a tool to validate methods of mitochondria isolation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The standardization of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) techniques is essential to enable and facilitate future comparisons. Neurospora crassa is a model organism with a lot of potential in different fields of study. Here we use N. crassa to develop and establish an assay to quantify mitochondrial DNA using qPCR. We tested strains with different geographical background and our data demonstrated the usefulness of this assay to quantify mitochondrial DNA in N. crassa. This technique can be useful in a wide variety of applications and in different types of studies.","['Neurospora crassa', 'DNA polymorphism', 'DNA quantitation', 'filamentous fungi', 'mitochondria isolation', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'mtDNA quantification', 'qPCR']",Letters in applied microbiology,Portugal,2020 Aug
36240974,The Neurospora crassa molybdate transporter: Characterizing a novel transporter homologous to the plant MOT1 family.,"Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential element for animals, plants, and fungi. To achieve biological activity in eukaryotes, Mo must be complexed into the molybdenum cofactor (Moco). Cells are known to take up Mo in the form of the oxyanion molybdate. However, molybdate transporters are scarcely characterized in the fungal kingdom. In plants and algae, molybdate is imported into the cell via two families of molybdate transporters (MOT), MOT1 and MOT2. For the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, a sequence homologous to the MOT1 family was previously annotated. Here we report a characterization of this molybdate-related transporter, encoded by the ncmot-1 gene. We found that the deletion of ncmot-1 leads to an accumulation of total Mo within the mycelium and a roughly 51 % higher tolerance against high molybdate levels when grown on ammonium medium. The localization of a GFP tagged NcMOT-1 was identified among the vacuolar membrane. Thereby, we propose NcMOT-1 as an exporter, transporting molybdate out of the vacuole into the cytoplasm. Lastly, the heterologous expression of NcMOT-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae verifies the functionality of this protein as a MOT. Our results open the way towards understanding molybdate transport as part of Mo homeostasis and Moco-biosynthesis in fungi.","['Molybdate transporter', 'Molybdenum cofactor', 'Molybdenum homeostasis', 'Molybdenum metabolism', 'Neurospora crassa']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Germany,2022 Nov
29801802,Neurospora crassa developmental control mediated by the FLB-3 transcription factor.,"Here, we report that the Neurospora crassa FLB-3 protein, the ortholog of the Aspergillus nidulans FlbC transcription factor, is required for developmental control. Deletion of flb-3 leads to changes in hyphae morphology and affects sexual and asexual development. We identified, as putative FLB-3 targets, the N. crassa aba-1, wet-1 and vos-1 genes, orthologs of the ones involved in A. nidulans asexual development and that work downstream of FlbC (abaA, wetA and vosA). In N. crassa, these three genes require FLB-3 for proper expression; however, they appear not to be required for normal development, as demonstrated by gene expression analyses during vegetative growth and asexual development. Moreover, mutant strains in the three genes conidiate well and produce viable conidia. We also determined FLB-3 DNA-binding preferences via protein-binding microarrays (PBMs) and demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that FLB-3 binds the aba-1, wet-1 and vos-1 promoters. Our data support an important role for FLB-3 in N. crassa development and highlight differences between the regulatory pathways controlled by this transcription factor in different fungal species.","['Development control', 'FLB-3', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Protein-binding microarrays (PBM)']",Fungal biology,Brazil,2018 Jun
31821884,Developing a tetO/TetR system in Neurospora crassa.,"The development of a tetO/TetR system in the fungus Neurospora crassa is described. The system includes (i) a synthetic gene encoding a TetR variant fused to GFP, and (ii) a standard tetO array integrated homologously, as a proof of principle, near the his-3 gene. The localization of TetR-GFP at the tetO array (observed by fluorescence microscopy) can be disrupted by the application of tetracycline. The full-length array is stable during vegetative growth, but it triggers strong repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) by the RID-dependent as well as the DIM-2-dependent pathways during the sexual phase. Thus, both RIP pathways must be inactivated to allow the faithful inheritance of the unmodified construct. In summary, this study introduces a new molecular tool into Neurospora research, and suggests that the standard tetO array can self-engage in recombination-independent homologous pairing.","['FROS', 'Fluorescent repressor operator system', 'Neurospora', 'RIP', 'Repeat-induced point mutation', 'TetR', 'tetO']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,France,2020 Mar

36744948,Developing a Temperature-Inducible Transcriptional Rheostat in Neurospora crassa.,"Heat shock protein (HSP)-encoding genes (hsp), part of the highly conserved heat shock response (HSR), are known to be induced by thermal stress in several organisms. In Neurospora crassa, three hsp genes, hsp30, hsp70, and hsp80, have been characterized; however, the role of defined cis elements in their responses to discrete changes in temperature remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, while also aiming to obtain a reliable fungal heat shock-inducible system, we analyzed different sections of each hsp promoter by assessing the expression of real-time transcriptional reporters. Whereas all three promoters and their resected versions were acutely induced by high temperatures, only hsp30 displayed a broad range of expression and high tunability, amply exceeding other inducible promoter systems existing in Neurospora, such as quinic acid- or light-inducible ones. As proof of concept, we employed one of these promoters to control the expression of clr-2, which encodes the master regulator of Neurospora cellulolytic capabilities. The resulting strain fails to grow on cellulose at 25 degrees C, whereas it grows robustly if heat shock pulses are delivered daily. Additionally, we designed two hsp30 synthetic promoters and characterized them, as well as the native promoters, using a gradient of high temperatures, yielding a wide range of responses to thermal stimuli. Thus, Neurospora hsp30-based promoters represent a new set of modular elements that can be used as transcriptional rheostats to adjust the expression of a gene of interest or for the implementation of regulated circuitries for synthetic biology and biotechnological strategies. IMPORTANCE A timely and dynamic response to strong temperature fluctuations is paramount for organismal biology. At the same time, inducible promoters are a powerful tool for fungal biotechnological and synthetic biology endeavors. In this work, we analyzed the activity of several N. crassa heat shock protein (hsp) promoters at a wide range of temperatures, observing that hsp30 exhibits remarkable sensitivity and a dynamic range of expression as we charted the response of this promoter to subtle increases in temperature, and also as we built and analyzed synthetic promoters based on hsp30 cis elements. As proof of concept, we tested the ability of hsp30 to provide tight control of a central process, cellulose degradation. While this study provides an unprecedented description of the regulation of the N. crassa hsp genes, it also contributes a noteworthy addition to the molecular toolset of transcriptional controllers in filamentous fungi.","['HSP', 'Neurospora', 'Neurospora crassa', 'heat shock', 'hsp promoters', 'inducible promoter', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic promoter', 'transcription']",mBio,Chile,2023 Feb 28
35353854,Wavelengths and irradiances modulate the circadian rhythm of Neurospora crassa.,"The circadian rhythm affects the biological evolution and operating mechanisms of organisms. The impact of light on the circadian rhythm is a significant concern for both biology and human well-being. However, the relation between different wavelengths, irradiances, and circadian rhythm is unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of four different monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED) light and two different irradiances on the circadian rhythm of a wild-type Neurospora crassa. The results demonstrated that the circadian rhythm of Neurospora crassa can be modulated by violet (lambdap = 393 nm), blue (lambdap = 462 nm), and green (lambdap = 521 nm) light, regardless of the irradiances, in the visible region. Unexpectedly, for the yellow light (lambdap = 591 nm), the 2 W/m2 light had a more significant impact on circadian rhythm modulation than the 0.04 W/m2 light had. Considering the highest energy of yellow light (2.25 eV) is lower than the High Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO)-Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) gap of WC-1 (2.43 eV). We speculate that there may be other potential photoreceptors that are involved in circadian rhythm modulation. The HOMO-LOMO gaps of these proteins are greater than 1.98 eV and less than 2.25 eV. These results provide a strong foundation for a deeper understanding of the impact of different light on the circadian rhythm and also shed light on the identification of new circadian rhythm modulation photoreceptors.",?,PloS one,China,2022
26198228,Epigenetic and Posttranslational Modifications in Light Signal Transduction and the Circadian Clock in Neurospora crassa.,"Blue light, a key abiotic signal, regulates a wide variety of physiological processes in many organisms. One of these phenomena is the circadian rhythm presents in organisms sensitive to the phase-setting effects of blue light and under control of the daily alternation of light and dark. Circadian clocks consist of autoregulatory alternating negative and positive feedback loops intimately connected with the cellular metabolism and biochemical processes. Neurospora crassa provides an excellent model for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in these phenomena. The White Collar Complex (WCC), a blue-light receptor and transcription factor of the circadian oscillator, and Frequency (FRQ), the circadian clock pacemaker, are at the core of the Neurospora circadian system. The eukaryotic circadian clock relies on transcriptional/translational feedback loops: some proteins rhythmically repress their own synthesis by inhibiting the activity of their transcriptional factors, generating self-sustained oscillations over a period of about 24 h. One of the basic mechanisms that perpetuate self-sustained oscillations is post translation modification (PTM). The acronym PTM generically indicates the addition of acetyl, methyl, sumoyl, or phosphoric groups to various types of proteins. The protein can be regulatory or enzymatic or a component of the chromatin. PTMs influence protein stability, interaction, localization, activity, and chromatin packaging. Chromatin modification and PTMs have been implicated in regulating circadian clock function in Neurospora. Research into the epigenetic control of transcription factors such as WCC has yielded new insights into the temporal modulation of light-dependent gene transcription. Here we report on epigenetic and protein PTMs in the regulation of the Neurospora crassa circadian clock. We also present a model that illustrates the molecular mechanisms at the basis of the blue light control of the circadian clock.","['Neurospora crassa', 'acetylation', 'chromatin remodeling', 'circadian rhythms', 'light signal transduction', 'methylation', 'phosphorylation']",International journal of molecular sciences,Italy. marco.proietto@uniroma1.it,2015 Jul 7

29119270,Functional diversity in the pH signaling pathway: an overview of the pathway regulation in Neurospora crassa.,"Microorganisms have the ability to adapt and respond to different environmental conditions, whether they are stressful or not. Although the detection and/or responding mechanisms are often unknown, a large number of proteins may participate in signal transduction pathways involved in environmental stimulus to induce physiological and cellular events. Here, we examine the important role in cell homeostasis that extracellular pH plays in different fungi, and summarize the recent data reported in distinct organisms, by comparing them to the well-characterized mechanisms firstly described in Aspergillus and yeast. While most of the knowledge regarding the cellular processes triggered by the pH signaling pathway is based on the work in these two organisms, new data have been emerging in a diverse group of filamentous fungi, namely the involvement of this signaling pathway in metabolism and fungal pathogenicity. In this review, we present the major aspects of the pH signaling pathway in different model organisms, focusing on the protein components and the biological processes influenced by this pathway. In particular, we discuss novel cellular processes regulated by this pathway in the fungus Neurospora crassa. The diversity of functional processes that are affected under pH stress highlights how broadly this condition impacts on basic cellular processes in fungi and reveals how divergent fungal species are.","['Ambient pH stress', 'Fungi', 'Reserve carbohydrate metabolism', 'Signaling pathways', 'Transcription factors']",Current genetics,Brazil,2018 Jun
35699373,HDA-2-Containing Complex Is Required for Activation of Catalase-3 Expression in Neurospora crassa.,"It is essential for aerobic organisms to maintain the homeostasis of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) for survival and adaptation to the environment. In line with other eukaryotes, the catalase of Neurospora crassa is an important enzyme for clearing ROS, and its expression is tightly regulated by the growth phase and various oxidative stresses. Our study reveals that, in N. crassa, histone deacetylase 2 (HDA-2) and its catalytic activity positively regulate the expression of the catalase-3 (cat-3) gene. HDA-2, SIF-2, and SNT-1 may form a subcomplex with such a regulation role. As expected, deletion of HDA-2 or SIF-2 subunit increased acetylation levels of histone H4, indicating that loss of HDA-2 complex fails to deacetylate H4 at the cat-3 locus. Furthermore, loss of HDA-2 or its catalytic activity led to dramatic decreases of TFIIB and RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) recruitment at the cat-3 locus and also resulted in high deposition of H2A.Z at the promoter and transcription start site (TSS) regions of the cat-3 gene. Collectively, this study strongly demonstrates that the HDA-2-containing complex activates the transcription of the cat-3 gene by facilitating preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly and antagonizing the inhibition of H2A.Z at the cat-3 locus through H4 acetylation. IMPORTANCE Clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is critical to the survival of aerobic organisms. In the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, catalase-3 (cat-3) expression is activated in response to H(2)O(2)-induced ROS stress. We found that histone deacetylase 2 (HDA-2) positively regulates cat-3 transcription in N. crassa; this is widely divergent from the classical repressive role of most histone deacetylases. Like HDA-2, the SIF-2 or SNT-1 subunit of HDA-2-containing complex plays a positive role in cat-3 transcription. Furthermore, we also found that HDA-2-containing complex provides an appropriate chromatin environment to facilitate PIC assembly and to antagonize the inhibition role of H2A.Z at the cat-3 locus through H4 acetylation. Taken together, our results establish a mechanism for how the HDA-2-containing complex regulates transcription of the cat-3 gene in N. crassa.","['Catalase-3', 'HDA-2', 'Histone H4 acetylation', 'Neurospora crassa']",mBio,China,2022 Aug 30
32152733,Two dominant selectable markers for genetic manipulation in Neurospora crassa.,"Neurospora crassa is an excellent model fungus for studies on molecular genetics, biochemistry, physiology, and molecular cell biology. Along with the rapid progress of Neurospora research, new tools facilitating more efficient and accurate genetic analysis are in high demand. Here, we tested whether the dominant selective makers widely used in yeasts are applicable in N. crassa. Among them, we found that the strains of N. crassa are sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotics, G418 and nourseothricin. 1000 mug/mL of G418 or 50 mug/mL of nourseothricin is sufficient to inhibit Neurospora growth completely. When the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) used in mammalian cells is expressed, N. crassa shows potent resistance to G418. This establishes G418-resistant marker as a dominant selectable marker to use in N. crassa. Similarly, when the nourseothricin acetyltransferase gene (nat) from Streptomyces noursei is induced by qa-2 promoter in the presence of quinic acid (QA), N. crassa shows potent resistance to nourseothricin. When nat is constitutively expressed by full-length or truncated versions of the promoter from the N. crassa cfp gene (NCU02193), or by the trpC promoter of Aspergillus nidulans, the growth of N. crassa in the presence of nourseothricin is proportional to the expression levels of Nat. Finally, these two markers are used to knock-out wc-2 or al-1 gene from the N. crassa genome. The successful development of these two markers in this study expands the toolbox for N. crassa and very likely for other filamentous fungi as well.","['Dominant drug resistance marker', 'Fungus', 'G418', 'Gene deletion', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Nourseothricin (NTC)']",Current genetics,China,2020 Aug
32389313,A circadian clock in Neurospora crassa functions during plant cell wall deconstruction.,"Circadian clocks are autonomous timers that are believed to confer organisms a selective advantage by enabling processes to occur at appropriate times of the day. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, 20-40 % of its genes are reported to be under circadian regulation, as assayed in simple sugar media. Although it has been well-described that Neurospora efficiently deconstructs plant cell wall components, little is known regarding the status of the clock when Neurospora grows on cellulosic material, or whether such a clock has an impact on any of the genes involved in this process. Through luciferase-based reporters and fluorescent detection assays, we show that a clock is functioning when Neurospora grows on cellulose-containing wheat straw as the only carbon and nitrogen source. Additionally, we found that the major cellobiohydrolase encoding gene involved in plant cell wall deconstruction, cbh-1, is rhythmically regulated by the Neurospora clock, in a manner that depends on cellulose concentration and on the transcription factor CRE-1, known as a key player in carbon-catabolite repression in this fungus. Our findings are a step towards a more comprehensive understanding on how clock regulation modulates cellulose degradation, and thus Neurospora's physiology.","['Cellulose degradation', 'Clock Regulation', 'Luciferase real-time reporter']",Fungal biology,Chile,2020 May
32001556,Marked Neurospora crassa Strains for Competition Experiments and Bayesian Methods for Fitness Estimates.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, a model microbial eukaryote, has a life cycle with many features that make it suitable for studying experimental evolution. However, it has lacked a general tool for estimating relative fitness of different strains in competition experiments. To remedy this need, we constructed N. crassa strains that contain a modified csr-1 locus and developed an assay for detecting the proportion of the marked strain using a post PCR high resolution melting assay. DNA extraction from spore samples can be performed on 96-well plates, followed by a PCR step, which allows many samples to be processed with ease. Furthermore, we suggest a Bayesian approach for estimating relative fitness from competition experiments that takes into account the uncertainty in measured strain proportions. We show that there is a fitness effect of the mating type locus, as mating type mat a has a higher competitive fitness than mat A The csr-1(*) marker also has a small fitness effect, but is still a suitable marker for competition experiments. As a proof of concept, we estimate the fitness effect of the qde-2 mutation, a gene in the RNA interference pathway, and show that its competitive fitness is lower than what would be expected from its mycelial growth rate alone.","['competitive fitness', 'experimental evolution', 'fungi', 'high resolution melting']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Finland ilkka.kronholm@jyu.fi,2020 Apr 9

33994113,Metabolic changes of Neurospora crassa in the presence of oleic acid for promoting lycopene production.,"Neurospora crassa has been generally recognized as a safe organism and possesses a remarkable ability to produce yellow-to-orange carotenoids. The present work mainly explored the potential mechanism of exogenous oleic acid on promoting lycopene production in N. crassa. Carbon flux was conducively channelized into the mevalonate metabolic pathway to synthesize more lycopene, associating with the increased levels of acetyl-CoA, NADPH and factors related to the mevalonate pathway. Additionally, exogenous oleic acid boosted the intracellular triacylglycerol production through de novo and ex novo fatty acid synthesis pathways, which contributed to improving the accumulation of lycopene via lipid bodies. Further, the regulated fatty acid profile also enhanced the storage capacity of lipid bodies. Consequently, this study provided an effective strategy to enhance the lycopene production in N. crassa by adding oleic acid to the culture medium and elucidated an extraordinary insight into the potential mechanism.","['Lycopene', 'Mevalonate metabolic pathway', 'Neurospora crass', 'Oleic acid', 'Triacylglycerol']",Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,China,2021 Aug

This study reports a mini-cellulase gene tox-1 from Neurospora crassa. The gene tox-1 was cloned in Escherichia coli after chimerization with the YebF gene and substitutions of certain isoleucine and valine with leucine residues. The yeast transformants could grow on rice straw-agar medium. The 44-amino acid peptide and its two mutant variants displayed potent cellulase activities in Congo Red assay and enzymatic assays. Conservative replacements with leucine have substantially increased the stabilities and half-lives of the peptides at alkaline pH and low and high temperatures and also the tolerance to organic solvents and surfactants, on the basis of activities toward cellose. The small size of the mini-cellulase would allow for commercially viable automatic chemical peptide synthesis. This work suggests that conservative leucine replacements may serve as a general strategy in the engineering of more robust enzymes with special features with little loss of activities.","['conservative amino acid replacements', 'enzyme assays', 'mini-cellulase', 'pH and thermal tolerance']",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,China,2016 Jun 15
34346207,The Neurospora crassa Inducible Q System Enables Simultaneous Optogenetic Amplification and Inversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Bidirectional Control of Gene Expression.,"Bidirectional optogenetic control of yeast gene expression has great potential for biotechnological applications. Our group has developed optogenetic inverter circuits that activate transcription using darkness, as well as amplifier circuits that reach high expression levels under limited light. However, because both types of circuits harness Gal4p and Gal80p from the galactose (GAL) regulon they cannot be used simultaneously. Here, we apply the Q System, a transcriptional activator/inhibitor system from Neurospora crassa, to build circuits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are inducible using quinic acid, darkness, or blue light. We develop light-repressed OptoQ-INVRT circuits that initiate darkness-triggered transcription within an hour of induction, as well as light-activated OptoQ-AMP circuits that achieve up to 39-fold induction. The Q System does not exhibit crosstalk with the GAL regulon, allowing coutilization of OptoQ-AMP circuits with previously developed OptoINVRT circuits. As a demonstration of practical applications in metabolic engineering, we show how simultaneous use of these circuits can be used to dynamically control both growth and production to improve acetoin production, as well as enable light-tunable co-production of geraniol and linalool, two terpenoids implicated in the hoppy flavor of beer. OptoQ-AMP and OptoQ-INVRT circuits enable simultaneous optogenetic signal amplification and inversion, providing powerful additions to the yeast optogenetic toolkit.","['Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'chemical inducer', 'dynamic control', 'gene circuits', 'inducible transcriptional control', 'metabolic engineering', 'optogenetics']",ACS synthetic biology,United States,2021 Aug 20
35951637,Data-driven modelling captures dynamics of the circadian clock of Neurospora crassa.,"Eukaryotic circadian clocks are based on self-sustaining, cell-autonomous oscillatory feedback loops that can synchronize with the environment via recurrent stimuli (zeitgebers) such as light. The components of biological clocks and their network interactions are becoming increasingly known, calling for a quantitative understanding of their role for clock function. However, the development of data-driven mathematical clock models has remained limited by the lack of sufficiently accurate data. Here we present a comprehensive model of the circadian clock of Neurospora crassa that describe free-running oscillations in constant darkness and entrainment in light-dark cycles. To parameterize the model, we measured high-resolution time courses of luciferase reporters of morning and evening specific clock genes in WT and a mutant strain. Fitting the model to such comprehensive data allowed estimating parameters governing circadian phase, period length and amplitude, and the response of genes to light cues. Our model suggests that functional maturation of the core clock protein Frequency causes a delay in negative feedback that is critical for generating circadian rhythms.",?,PLoS computational biology,Germany,2022 Aug
23964982,Interconnections of reactive oxygen species homeostasis and circadian rhythm in Neurospora crassa.,"SIGNIFICANCE: Both circadian rhythm and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are fundamental features of aerobic eukaryotic cells. The circadian clock enhances the fitness of organisms by enabling them to anticipate cycling changes in the surroundings. ROS generation in the cell is often altered in response to environmental changes, but oscillations in ROS levels may also reflect endogenous metabolic fluctuations governed by the circadian clock. On the other hand, an effective regulation and timing of antioxidant mechanisms may be crucial in the defense of cellular integrity. Thus, an interaction between the circadian timekeeping machinery and ROS homeostasis or signaling in both directions may be of advantage at all phylogenetic levels. RECENT ADVANCES: The Frequency-White Collar-1 and White Collar-2 oscillator (FWO) of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is well characterized at the molecular level. Several members of the ROS homeostasis were found to be controlled by the circadian clock, and ROS levels display circadian rhythm in Neurospora. On the other hand, multiple data indicate that ROS affect the molecular oscillator. CRITICAL ISSUES: Increasing evidence suggests the interplay between ROS homeostasis and oscillators that may be partially or fully independent of the FWO. In addition, ROS may be part of a complex cellular network synchronizing non-transcriptional oscillators with timekeeping machineries based on the classical transcription-translation feedback mechanism. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Further investigations are needed to clarify how the different layers of the bidirectional interactions between ROS homeostasis and circadian regulation are interconnected.",?,Antioxidants & redox signaling,Hungary ,2014 Jun 20
35244156,The genome organization of Neurospora crassa at high resolution uncovers principles of fungal chromosome topology.,"The eukaryotic genome must be precisely organized for its proper function, as genome topology impacts transcriptional regulation, cell division, replication, and repair, among other essential processes. Disruptions to human genome topology can lead to diseases, including cancer. The advent of chromosome conformation capture with high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C) to assess genome organization has revolutionized the study of nuclear genome topology; Hi-C has elucidated numerous genomic structures, including chromosomal territories, active/silent chromatin compartments, Topologically Associated Domains, and chromatin loops. While low-resolution heatmaps can provide important insights into chromosomal level contacts, high-resolution Hi-C datasets are required to reveal folding principles of individual genes. Of particular interest are high-resolution chromosome conformation datasets of organisms modeling the human genome. Here, we report the genome topology of the fungal model organism Neurospora crassa at a high resolution. Our composite Hi-C dataset, which merges 2 independent datasets generated with restriction enzymes that monitor euchromatin (DpnII) and heterochromatin (MseI), along with our DpnII/MseI double digest dataset, provide exquisite detail for both the conformation of entire chromosomes and the folding of chromatin at the resolution of individual genes. Within constitutive heterochromatin, we observe strong yet stochastic internal contacts, while euchromatin enriched with either activating or repressive histone post-translational modifications associates with constitutive heterochromatic regions, suggesting intercompartment contacts form to regulate transcription. Consistent with this, a strain with compromised heterochromatin experiences numerous changes in gene expression. Our high-resolution Neurospora Hi-C datasets are outstanding resources to the fungal community and provide valuable insights into higher organism genome topology.","['Neurospora', 'chromatin', 'genome organization', 'genome topology', 'in situ Hi-C']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",USA,2022 May 6

In this study, we report engineering recombinant Neurospora crassa strains which are able to produce cellobionate, an organic acid, from cellulose without any enzyme addition. Recombinant strains were constructed by heterologously expressing laccase genes from different sources under different promoters in N. crassa F5Deltamus-51Deltaace-1Deltacre-1DeltandvB which has six out of seven beta-glucosidase (bgl), two transcription factor (cre1 and ace-1), and the cellobionate phosphorylase (ndvB) genes deleted. The strain expressing laccase from Botrytis aclada under a copper metallothionein promoter (HL10) produced the highest laccase activity.

Although this fungus is known as a saprotroph, it normally appears on burned vegetations or trees after forest fires. However, due to a lack of experimental evidence, the nature of its association with living plants remains enigmatic. Here we report that Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is a host plant for N. crassa. The endophytic lifestyle of N. crassa was found in its interaction with Scots pine. Moreover, the fungus can switch to a pathogenic state when its balanced interaction with the host is disrupted. Our data reveal previously unknown lifestyles of N. crassa, which are likely controlled by both environmental and host factors.

29258423,The coding and noncoding transcriptome of Neurospora crassa.,"BACKGROUND: Long non protein coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in many different organisms and cell types. Emerging examples emphasize the biological importance of these RNA species but their regulation and functions remain poorly understood. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the annotation and characterization of lncRNAs is incomplete. RESULTS: We have performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of Neurospora crassa by using ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and polysome fractionation datasets. We have annotated and characterized 1478 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and 1056 natural antisense transcripts, indicating that 20% of the RNA Polymerase II transcripts of Neurospora are not coding for protein. Both classes of lncRNAs accumulate at lower levels than protein-coding mRNAs and they are considerably shorter. Our analysis showed that the vast majority of lincRNAs and antisense transcripts do not contain introns and carry less H3K4me2 modifications than similarly expressed protein coding genes. In contrast, H3K27me3 modifications inversely correlate with transcription of protein coding and lincRNA genes. We show furthermore most lincRNA sequences evolve rapidly, even between phylogenetically close species. CONCLUSIONS: Our transcriptome analyses revealed distinct features of Neurospora lincRNAs and antisense transcripts in comparison to mRNAs and showed that the prevalence of noncoding transcripts in this organism is higher than previously anticipated. The study provides a broad repertoire and a resource for further studies of lncRNAs.","['Antisense', 'Neurospora', 'Noncoding RNA', 'Splicing', 'Transcriptome']",BMC genomics,Germany,2017 Dec 19
35150841,F-actin dynamics following mechanical injury of Trichoderma atroviride and Neurospora crassa hyphae.,"We investigated hyphae regeneration in Trichoderma atroviride and Neurospora crassa, with particular focus on determining the role of the actin cytoskeleton after mechanical injury. Filamentous actin (F-actin) dynamics was observed by live-cell confocal microscopy in both T. atroviride and N. crassa strains expressing Lifeact-GFP. In growing hyphae of both fungi, F-actin localized in three different structural forms: patches, cables and actomyosin rings. Most patches were conspicuously arranged in a collar in the hyphal subapex. A strong F-actin signal, likely actin filaments, colocalized with the core of the Spitzenkorper. Filaments and cables of F-actin were observed along the cortex throughout hyphae. Following mechanical damage at the margin of growing mycelia of T. atroviride and N. crassa, the severed hyphae lost their cytoplasmic contents, but plugging of the septal pore by a Woronin body occured, and the rest of the hyphal tube remained whole. In both fungi, patches of F-actin began accumulating next to the plugged septum. Regeneration was attained by the emergence of a new hyphal tube as an extension of the plugged septum wall. The septum wall was gradually remodeled into the apical wall of the emerging hypha. Whereas in T. atroviride the re-initiation of polarized growth took   approximately  1 h, in N. crassa, actin patch accumulation began almost immediately, and new growing hyphae were observed  approximately  30 min after injury. By confocal microscopy, we found that chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), a microvesicle (chitosome) component, accumulated next to the plugged septum in regenerating hyphae of N. crassa. We concluded that the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in hyphal regeneration by supporting membrane remodeling, helping to facilitate transport of vesicles responsible for new wall growth and organization of the new tip-growth apparatus.","['Actin', 'Cell wall', 'Mechanical injury', 'Polarized growth', 'Septal plugging']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2022 Apr
33751112,Shannon entropy as a metric for conditional gene expression in Neurospora crassa.,"Neurospora crassa has been an important model organism for molecular biology and genetics for over 60 years. Neurospora crassa has a complex life cycle, with over 28 distinct cell types and is capable of transcriptional responses to many environmental conditions including nutrient availability, temperature, and light. To quantify variation in N. crassa gene expression, we analyzed public expression data from 97 conditions and calculated the Shannon Entropy value for Neurospora's approximately 11,000 genes. Entropy values can be used to estimate the variability in expression for a single gene over a range of conditions and be used to classify individual genes as constitutive or condition-specific. Shannon entropy has previously been used measure the degree of tissue specificity of multicellular plant or animal genes. We use this metric here to measure variable gene expression in a microbe and provide this information as a resource for the N. crassa research community.

32540184,Analysis of localization of cell-cycle regulators in Neurospora crassa.,"Most fungi are multinucleated organisms. In some fungi, they have asynchronous nuclei in the same cytoplasm. We analyzed a cell-cycle regulation mechanism using a model fungus Neurospora crassa, which can make heterokaryon cells. G1/S cyclin CLN-1 and cyclin-dependent kinase CDC-2 were tagged with different fluorescence in different strains and expressed. By forming a heterokaryon strain of these, two different fluorescence-tagged proteins were expressed in the same cytoplasm. CDC-2 was localized in all nuclei, whereas CLN-1 was not detected in most of the nuclei and was dispersed in the cytoplasm with small granular clusters. This indicates that in multinucleated fungi, cell-cycle regulators, similar to other proteins, are shared around the nuclei regardless of different cell-cycle stages. Moreover, each nucleus can select and use a special cell-cycle regulator only when it is necessary. Fungal nuclei may have a novel pickup mechanism of necessary proteins from their cytoplasm at the point of use.","['CDK', 'Cyclin', 'Forced heterokaryon', 'Multinucleated fungi', 'Tagged protein']",Fungal biology,Japan,2020 Jul
25381238,Engineering Neurospora crassa for improved cellobiose and cellobionate production.,"We report engineering Neurospora crassa to improve the yield of cellobiose and cellobionate from cellulose. A previously engineered strain of N. crassa (F5) with six of seven beta-glucosidase (bgl) genes knocked out was shown to produce cellobiose and cellobionate directly from cellulose without the addition of exogenous cellulases. In this study, the F5 strain was further modified to improve the yield of cellobiose and cellobionate from cellulose by increasing cellulase production and decreasing product consumption. The effects of two catabolite repression genes, cre-1 and ace-1, on cellulase production were investigated. The F5 Deltaace-1 mutant showed no improvement over the wild type. The F5 Deltacre-1 and F5 Deltaace-1 Deltacre-1 strains showed improved cellobiose dehydrogenase and exoglucanase expression. However, this improvement in cellulase expression did not lead to an improvement in cellobiose or cellobionate production. The cellobionate phosphorylase gene (ndvB) was deleted from the genome of F5 Deltaace-1 Deltacre-1 to prevent the consumption of cellobiose and cellobionate. Despite a slightly reduced hydrolysis rate, the F5 Deltaace-1 Deltacre-1 DeltandvB strain converted 75% of the cellulose consumed to the desired products, cellobiose and cellobionate, compared to 18% converted by the strain F5 Deltaace-1 Deltacre-1.",?,Applied and environmental microbiology,USA,2015 Jan
34523983,Aspects of the Neurospora crassa Sulfur Starvation Response Are Revealed by Transcriptional Profiling and DNA Affinity Purification Sequencing.,"Accurate nutrient sensing is important for rapid fungal growth and exploitation of available resources. Sulfur is an important nutrient source found in a number of biological macromolecules, including proteins and lipids. The model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is capable of utilizing sulfur found in a variety of sources from amino acids to sulfate. During sulfur starvation, the transcription factor CYS-3 is responsible for upregulation of genes involved in sulfur uptake and assimilation. Using a combination of RNA sequencing and DNA affinity purification sequencing, we performed a global survey of the N. crassa sulfur starvation response and the role of CYS-3 in regulating sulfur-responsive genes. The CYS-3 transcription factor bound the promoters and regulated genes involved in sulfur metabolism. Additionally, CYS-3 directly activated the expression of a number of uncharacterized transporter genes, suggesting that regulation of sulfur import is an important aspect of regulation by CYS-3. CYS-3 also directly regulated the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial electron transfer. During sulfur starvation, genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, such as amino acid and nucleic acid metabolic pathways, along with genes encoding proteases and nucleases that are necessary for scavenging nitrogen, were activated. Sulfur starvation also caused changes in the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as those encoding glycosyl hydrolases. Thus, our data suggest a connection between sulfur metabolism and other aspects of cellular metabolism. IMPORTANCE Identification of nutrients present in the environment is a challenge common to all organisms. Sulfur is an important nutrient source found in proteins, lipids, and electron carriers that are required for the survival of filamentous fungi such as Neurospora crassa. Here, we transcriptionally profiled the response of N. crassa to characterize the global response to sulfur starvation. We also used DNA affinity purification sequencing to identify the direct downstream targets of the transcription factor responsible for regulating genes involved in sulfur uptake and assimilation. Along with genes involved in sulfur metabolism, this transcription factor regulated a number of uncharacterized transporter genes and genes involved in mitochondrial electron transfer. Our data also suggest a connection between sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon metabolism, indicating that the regulation of a number of metabolic pathways is intertwined.","['DAP-seq', 'nutrient sensing', 'sulfur starvation response', 'transcriptional profiling']",mSphere,USA,2021 Oct 27

Loss of CPS-1 results in a cell wall defect that affects all stages of the N. crassa life cycle, including vegetative growth, protoperithecia (female mating structure) development, and conidia (asexual spore) development. The cell wall of cps-1 deletion mutants is sensitive to cell wall perturbation reagents. Our results demonstrate that CPS-1 is required for the incorporation of cell wall proteins into the cell wall and plays a critical role in cell wall biogenesis.

32432345,Quantitative genetics of temperature performance curves of Neurospora crassa.,"Earth's temperature is increasing due to anthropogenic CO 2 emissions; and organisms need either to adapt to higher temperatures, migrate into colder areas, or face extinction. Temperature affects nearly all aspects of an organism's physiology via its influence on metabolic rate and protein structure, therefore genetic adaptation to increased temperature may be much harder to achieve compared to other abiotic stresses. There is still much to be learned about the evolutionary potential for adaptation to higher temperatures, therefore we studied the quantitative genetics of growth rates in different temperatures that make up the thermal performance curve of the fungal model system Neurospora crassa. We studied the amount of genetic variation for thermal performance curves and examined possible genetic constraints by estimating the G-matrix. We observed a substantial amount of genetic variation for growth in different temperatures, and most genetic variation was for performance curve elevation. Contrary to common theoretical assumptions, we did not find strong evidence for genetic trade-offs for growth between hotter and colder temperatures. We also simulated short-term evolution of thermal performance curves of N. crassa, and suggest that they can have versatile responses to selection.","['Evolvability', 'G-matrix', 'fungi', 'phenotypic plasticity', 'reaction norm']",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,Finland,2020 Aug

30842206,The Neurospora crassa Standard Oak Ridge Background Exhibits Atypically Efficient Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA.,"Meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD), an RNAi-mediated gene silencing process, is efficient in crosses made in the Neurospora crassa standard Oak Ridge (OR) genetic background. However, MSUD was decidedly less efficient when the OR-derived MSUD testers were crossed with many wild-isolated strains (W), suggesting that either sequence heterozygosity in tester x W crosses suppresses MSUD, or that OR represents the MSUD-conducive extreme in the range of genetic variation in MSUD efficiency. Our results support the latter model. MSUD was less efficient in near-isogenic crosses made in the novel N. crassa B/S1 genetic background, and in N. tetrasperma strain 85. Possibly, in B/S1 and 85, additional regulatory cues, absent from OR, calibrate the MSUD response. A locus in distal chromosome 1R appears to underlie the OR vs. B/S1 difference. Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) destroys duplicated genes by G:C to A:T mutation of duplicated DNA sequences. Chromosome segment duplications (Dps) dominantly suppress RIP, possibly by titrating out the RIP machinery. In Dp x N crosses, the Dp-borne genes cannot pair properly, hence efficient MSUD, as in OR, silences them and renders the crosses barren. We speculate that the increased productivity engendered by inefficient MSUD enables small duplications to escape RIP.","['RIP suppression', 'chromosome segment duplication', 'genome heterozygosity', 'introgression']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",India,2019 May 7

36040303,"A moonlighting function of a chitin polysaccharide monooxygenase, CWR-1, in Neurospora crassa allorecognition.","Organisms require the ability to differentiate themselves from organisms of different or even the same species. Allorecognition processes in filamentous fungi are essential to ensure identity of an interconnected syncytial colony to protect it from exploitation and disease. Neurospora crassa has three cell fusion checkpoints controlling formation of an interconnected mycelial network. The locus that controls the second checkpoint, which allows for cell wall dissolution and subsequent fusion between cells/hyphae, cwr (cell wall remodeling), encodes two linked genes, cwr-1 and cwr-2. Previously, it was shown that cwr-1 and cwr-2 show severe linkage disequilibrium with six different haplogroups present in N. crassa populations. Isolates from an identical cwr haplogroup show robust fusion, while somatic cell fusion between isolates of different haplogroups is significantly blocked in cell wall dissolution. The cwr-1 gene encodes a putative polysaccharide monooxygenase (PMO). Herein we confirm that CWR-1 is a C1-oxidizing chitin PMO. We show that the catalytic (PMO) domain of CWR-1 was sufficient for checkpoint function and cell fusion blockage; however, through analysis of active-site, histidine-brace mutants, the catalytic activity of CWR-1 was ruled out as a major factor for allorecognition. Swapping a portion of the PMO domain (V86 to T130) did not switch cwr haplogroup specificity, but rather cells containing this chimera exhibited a novel haplogroup specificity. Allorecognition to mediate cell fusion blockage is likely occurring through a protein-protein interaction between CWR-1 with CWR-2. These data highlight a moonlighting role in allorecognition of the CWR-1 PMO domain.","['allorecognition', 'cell fusion checkpoint', 'chitin', 'genetics', 'genomics', 'neurospora', 'non-self-recognition', 'polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'somatic cell fusion']",eLife,United States,2022 Aug 30
33727349,The Predicted Mannosyltransferase GT69-2 Antagonizes RFW-1 To Regulate Cell Fusion in Neurospora crassa.,"Filamentous fungi undergo somatic cell fusion to create a syncytial, interconnected hyphal network which confers a fitness benefit during colony establishment. However, barriers to somatic cell fusion between genetically different cells have evolved that reduce invasion by parasites or exploitation by maladapted genetic entities (cheaters). Here, we identified a predicted mannosyltransferase, glycosyltransferase family 69 protein (GT69-2) that was required for somatic cell fusion in Neurospora crassa Cells lacking GT69-2 prematurely ceased chemotropic signaling and failed to complete cell wall dissolution and membrane merger in pairings with wild-type cells or between Deltagt69-2 cells (self fusion). However, loss-of-function mutations in the linked regulator of cell fusion and cell wall remodeling-1 (rfw-1) locus suppressed the self-cell-fusion defects of Deltagt69-2 cells, although Deltagt69-2 Deltarfw-1 double mutants still failed to undergo fusion with wild-type cells. Both GT69-2 and RFW-1 localized to the Golgi apparatus. Genetic analyses indicated that RFW-1 negatively regulates cell wall remodeling-dependent processes, including cell wall dissolution during cell fusion, separation of conidia during asexual sporulation, and conidial germination. GT69-2 acts as an antagonizer to relieve or prevent negative functions on cell fusion by RFW-1. In Neurospora species and N. crassa populations, alleles of gt69-2 were highly polymorphic and fell into two discrete haplogroups. In all isolates within haplogroup I, rfw-1 was conserved and linked to gt69-2 All isolates within haplogroup II lacked rfw-1. These data indicated that gt69-2/rfw-1 are under balancing selection and provide new mechanisms regulating cell wall remodeling during cell fusion and conidial separation.IMPORTANCE Cell wall remodeling is a dynamic process that balances cell wall integrity versus cell wall dissolution. In filamentous fungi, cell wall dissolution is required for somatic cell fusion and conidial separation during asexual sporulation. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, allorecognition checkpoints regulate the cell fusion process between genetically different cells. Our study revealed two linked loci with transspecies polymorphisms and under coevolution, rfw-1 and gt69-2, which form a coordinated system to regulate cell wall remodeling during somatic cell fusion, conidial separation, and asexual spore germination. RFW-1 acts as a negative regulator of these three processes, while GT69-2 functions antagonistically to RFW-1. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms involved in regulation of fungal cell wall remodeling during growth and development.","['CAP59', 'Neurospora', 'allorecognition', 'cell fusion', 'cell wall', 'chemotropism', 'glycosyltransferase', 'mannosyltransferase']",mBio,USA,2021 Mar 16
30503329,Neurospora crassa family GH72 glucanosyltransferases function to crosslink cell wall glycoprotein N-linked galactomannan to cell wall lichenin.,"The formation of a glucan/chitin/glycoprotein cell wall matrix is vital for fungal survival, growth, and morphogenesis. The cell wall proteins are important cell wall components and function in adhesion, signal transduction, and as cell wall structural elements. In this report we demonstrate that Neurospora crassa GH72 glucan transferases function to crosslink cell wall glycoproteins into the cell wall. With an in vitro assay, we show that the glucan transferases are able to attach lichenin, a cell wall glucan with a repeating beta-1,4-glucose-beta-1,4-glucose-beta-1,3-glucose structure, to cell wall glycoproteins. We propose that the pathway for attachment of lichenin to the glycoprotein has four steps. First, N-linked oligosaccharides present on the glycoproteins are modified by the addition of a galactomannan. As part of our report we have characterized the structure of the galactomannan, which consists of an alpha-1,6-mannose backbone with galactofuranose side chains. In the second step, the galactomannan is processed by members of the GH76 alpha-1,6-mannanases. In the third step, the glucan transferases cleave the lichenin and create substrate-enzyme intermediates. In the final step, the transferases transfer the lichenin to the processed galactomannan. We demonstrate that the N. crassa glucan transferases have demonstrate specificity for the processed galactomannan and for lichenin. The energy from the cleaved glycosidic bond in lichenin is retained in the substrate-enzyme intermediate and used to create a new glycosidic bond between the lichenin and the processed galactomannan. The pathway effectively crosslinks glycoproteins into the fungal cell wall.","['Cell wall', 'Fungi', 'Glycosyltransferase', 'N-linked glycosylation', 'Neurospora', 'Oligosaccharide', 'Protein cross-linking']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,USA,2019 Feb
26694141,Neurospora crassa transcriptomics reveals oxidative stress and plasma membrane homeostasis biology genes as key targets in response to chitosan.,"Chitosan is a natural polymer with antimicrobial activity. Chitosan causes plasma membrane permeabilization and induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Neurospora crassa. We have determined the transcriptional profile of N. crassa to chitosan and identified the main gene targets involved in the cellular response to this compound. Global network analyses showed membrane, transport and oxidoreductase activity as key nodes affected by chitosan. Activation of oxidative metabolism indicates the importance of ROS and cell energy together with plasma membrane homeostasis in N. crassa response to chitosan. Deletion strain analysis of chitosan susceptibility pointed NCU03639 encoding a class 3 lipase, involved in plasma membrane repair by lipid replacement, and NCU04537 a MFS monosaccharide transporter related to assimilation of simple sugars, as main gene targets of chitosan. NCU10521, a glutathione S-transferase-4 involved in the generation of reducing power for scavenging intracellular ROS is also a determinant chitosan gene target. Ca(2+) increased tolerance to chitosan in N. crassa. Growth of NCU10610 (fig 1 domain) and SYT1 (a synaptotagmin) deletion strains was significantly increased by Ca(2+) in the presence of chitosan. Both genes play a determinant role in N. crassa membrane homeostasis.

35468928,The macroscopic limit to synchronization of cellular clocks in single cells of Neurospora crassa.,"We determined the macroscopic limit for phase synchronization of cellular clocks in an artificial tissue created by a ""big chamber"" microfluidic device to be about 150,000 cells or less. The dimensions of the microfluidic chamber allowed us to calculate an upper limit on the radius of a hypothesized quorum sensing signal molecule of 13.05 nm using a diffusion approximation for signal travel within the device. The use of a second microwell microfluidic device allowed the refinement of the macroscopic limit to a cell density of 2166 cells per fixed area of the device for phase synchronization. The measurement of averages over single cell trajectories in the microwell device supported a deterministic quorum sensing model identified by ensemble methods for clock phase synchronization. A strong inference framework was used to test the communication mechanism in phase synchronization of quorum sensing versus cell-to-cell contact, suggesting support for quorum sensing. Further evidence came from showing phase synchronization was density-dependent.",?,Scientific reports,USA,2022 Apr 25
36517150,Two high-mobility group domains of MHG1 are necessary to maintain mtDNA in Neurospora crassa.,"The mhg1 (NCU02695/ada-23) gene encodes the mitochondrial high-mobility group box (HMG-box or HMGB) protein in Neurospora crassa. The mhg1 KO strain (mhg1(KO)) has mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) instability and a short lifespan; however, the function of MHG1 remains unclear. To investigate the role of this protein in the maintenance of mtDNA, domain deleted MHG1 proteins were expressed in the mhg1(KO) strain, and their effects were analyzed. We identified two putative HMG-domains, HMGBI and HMGBII. Although deletion of the HMG-box did not abolish MHG1's mitochondrial localization, the mhg1(KO) phenotype of a severe growth defect and a high sensitivity to mutagens could not be restored by introduction of HMG-box deleted mhg1 gene into the KO strain. It was indicated that recombinant full-length MHG1, i.e., mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) containing protein, did not exhibit explicit DNA binding, whereas the MHG1 protein truncated for the MTS sequence did in vitro by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, recombinant MHG1 protein lacking MTS and HMG-domains, either HMGBI or HMGBII, had DNA affinity and an altered band shift pattern compared with MTS-truncated MHG1 protein. These results suggest that cleavage of MTS and appropriate DNA binding via HMG-domains are indispensable for maintaining mtDNA in N. crassa.","['DNA-protein complexes', 'Filamentous fungus', 'HMG-box', 'Short lifespan', 'mtDNA maintenance']",Fungal biology,Japan,2022 Nov-Dec
35944835,The cytoplasmic microtubule array in Neurospora crassa depends on microtubule-organizing centers at spindle pole bodies and microtubule +end-depending pseudo-MTOCs at septa.,"gamma-Tubulin ring complexes (gamma-TuRC) mediate nucleation and anchorage of microtubules (MTs) to microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). In fungi, the spindle pole body (SPB) is the functional equivalent of the centrosome, which is the main MTOC. In addition, non-centrosomal MTOCs (ncMTOCs) contribute to MT formation in some fungi like Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Aspergillus nidulans. In A. nidulans, MTOCs are anchored at septa (sMTOC) and share components of the outer plaque of the SPB. Here we show that the Neurospora crassa SPB is embedded in the nuclear envelope, with the gamma-TuRC targeting proteins PCP-1(Pcp1/PcpA) located at the inner plaque and APS-2(Mto1/ApsB) located at the outer plaque of the SPB. PCP-1 was a specific component of nuclear MTOCs, while APS-2 was also present at the septal pore. Although gamma-tubulin was only detected at the nucleus, spontaneous MT nucleation occurred in the apical and subapical cytoplasm during recovery from benomyl-induced MT depolymerization experiments. There was no evidence for MT nucleation at septa. However, without benomyl treatment MT plus-ends were organized in the septal pore through MTB-3(EB1). Those septal MT plus ends polymerized MTs from septa in interphase cells Thus we conclude that the SPB is the only MT nucleation site in N. crassa, but the septal pore aids the MT network arrangement through the anchorage of the MT plus-ends through a pseudo-MTOC.","['Aps-2', 'MTB-3', 'MTOCs', 'Microtubules', 'Neurospora crassa', 'PCP-1', 'SPA-18', 'SPA10', 'Spindle pole bodies', 'gamma-Tubulin']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2022 Sep

The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis IMAC eluent, revealed  approximately 18 proteins with a similarity in the proteome pattern of Ca(2+) /Sr(2+) fractions. Diethyl aminoethyl chromatography showed five proteins in common in binding to Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) , were subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The sequence analysis was studied for the determination of metal-binding site prediction by CHED software indicating that all five were found to have a high affinity toward Ca(2+) . From these five, two were randomly selected and denoted as CWP-A (possess five Ca binding sites of six metal-binding sites) and CWP-B (possess six binding sites of eight metal-binding sites). They were selected for further characterization studies to determine their Ca(2+) bound Sr(2+) binding properties. Surprisingly, these proteins were able to bind Sr(2+) ions (29 mumol) with equal affinity as to Ca(2+) ions (42 mumol) by means of direct binding, and/or by displacing calcium as observed in metal-dependent proteolytic protection, fluorescence-based metal exchange assays, and molecular simulation studies. From the results, we demonstrate for the first time, that there is a stoichiometry between Ca(2+) (an essential macro elemental metal ion) and Sr(2+) ions (a nonessential element for which no reported metabolic activity is reported) for the metal-binding sites on cell wall proteins. This stoichiometry could be due to similar atomic dimensions and metal-protein structure stabilizing properties of Sr(2+) compared to Ca(2+) .","['Ca2+ binding ability', 'Ca2+/Sr2+ competetion', 'Neurospora crassa', 'cell wall proteins', 'metal-binding sites']",Journal of basic microbiology,India,2022 May
32525814,Functional dissection of gamma-aminobutyric acid metabolism in Neurospora crassa.,"The GABA shunt is one of the metabolic pathways that is ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in fungi is required in the stress responses, virulence and development. The number of genes encoding glutamate decarboxylase (gad), GABA transaminase (gta) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ssadh) varies between fungal species. The genome-wide analysis in Neurospora crassa resulted in the identification of a gta and a ssadh. Disruption of either gta or ssadh decreased respiration rate and biomass accumulation, reduced growth on GABA and beta-alanine. The gta and ssadh mutants exhibited aberrant hyphal morphology and displayed differential transcription of the GABA shunt genes. In the gta mutant, protoperithecia and perithecia formation was almost completely suppressed in the presence of GABA and beta-alanine, indicating GTA requirement for the turnover of these amino acids. The strains displayed differential metabolic dysregulations in response to different nitrogen sources. The phenotypic differences between the gta and ssadh mutants could be contributed to accumulation of intermediates of the GABA shunt and/or GABA shunt-independent functions. Together, our data suggest that the GABA shunt could function as a moderate modulator of multiple biological events, including respiration, energy metabolism, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, growth, as well as sexual development in N. crassa.",?,General physiology and biophysics,Slovakia,2020 May
34634482,Enzymatic characterization of agmatinase (AGM-1) from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.,"Agmatinase is a metallohydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of agmatine to produce urea and putrescine. Although its role in organisms is still under study, there are no reports of this family of enzymes in filamentous fungi. Recently, a protein showing agmatinase activity was reported in Neurospora crassa. Therefore, the aim of this work is to determine if the protein (AGM-1) found in the filamentous fungus N. crassa is a true agmatinase. The protein AGM-1was purified directly from N. crassa cultures, and its enzymatic characterization was carried out. The catalytic parameters such as optimum pH, thermostability, transformation kinetics, and activity in the presence of a cofactor were determined. The results show that AGM-1 can use manganese as a cofactor for its enzymatic activity, showing a transformation rate constant (k(cat)) of 77 s(-1) and an affinity constant (K(M)) of 50.5 mM. The protein loses 50% of its activity when incubated 15 min at 30  degrees C and reaches maximal enzymatic activity at a pH range of 8-8.5. Our results indicate that the AGM-1 from N. crassa shows similar characteristics to true agmatinases already reported in other organisms. Thus, our findings strongly support that the protein annotated as hypothetical agmatinase in N. crassa is a true agmatinase.","['Agmatinase', 'Agmatine', 'Arginase', 'Fungi', 'Polyamines']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2021 Dec
31636083,Programmed Cell Death in Neurospora crassa Is Controlled by the Allorecognition Determinant rcd-1.,"Nonself recognition following cell fusion between genetically distinct individuals of the same species in filamentous fungi often results in a programmed cell death (PCD) reaction, where the heterokaryotic fusion cell is compartmentalized and rapidly killed. The allorecognition process plays a key role as a defense mechanism that restricts genome exploitation, resource plundering, and the spread of deleterious senescence plasmids and mycoviruses. Although a number of incompatibility systems have been described that function in mature hyphae, less is known about the PCD pathways in asexual spores, which represent the main infectious unit in various human and plant fungal pathogens. Here, we report the identification of regulator of cell death-1 (rcd-1), a novel allorecognition gene, controlling PCD in germinating asexual spores of Neurospora crassa; rcd-1 is one of the most polymorphic genes in the genomes of wild N. crassa isolates. The coexpression of two antagonistic rcd-1-1 and rcd-1-2 alleles was necessary and sufficient to trigger cell death in fused germlings and in hyphae. Based on analysis of wild populations of N. crassa and N. discreta, rcd-1 alleles appeared to be under balancing selection and associated with trans-species polymorphisms. We shed light on genomic rearrangements that could have led to the emergence of the incompatibility system in Neurospora and show that rcd-1 belongs to a much larger gene family in fungi. Overall, our work contributes toward a better understanding of allorecognition and PCD in an underexplored developmental stage of filamentous fungi.","['Neurospora', 'allorecognition', 'cell fusion', 'heterokaryon incompatibility', 'programmed cell death']",Genetics,California 94720,2019 Dec
26951369,Microtubules and associated molecular motors in Neurospora crassa.,"The cytoskeleton provides structure, shape and movement to various cells. Microtubules (MTs) are tubular structures made of alpha and beta-tubulin heterodimers organized in 13 protofilaments, forming a hollow cylinder. A vast group of MT-associated proteins determines the function, behavior and interaction of the MTs with other cellular components. Among these proteins, molecular motors such as the dynein-dynactin complex and kinesin superfamily play roles in MT organization and organelle transport. This article focuses on the MT cytoskeleton and associated molecular motors in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa In addition to reviewing current available information for this fungus and contrasting it with knowledge of other fungal species, we present new experimental results that support the role of dynein, dynactin and conventional kinesin in MT organization, dynamics and transport of subcellular structures (nuclei and secretory vesicles). In wild type hyphae of N. crassa, cytoplasmic MTs are arranged longitudinally along hyphae and display a helical curvature. They interlace with one another to form a network throughout the cytoplasm. N. crassa dynein and dynactin mutants have a scant and disorganized MT cytoskeleton, an erratic and reduced Spitzenkorper (Spk) and distorted hyphal morphology. In contrast, hyphae of mutants with defective conventional kinesin exhibit only minor disruptions in MT and Spk organization. Although nuclear positioning is affected in all mutants, the MT-associated motor proteins are not major contributors to nuclear movement during hyphal growth. Cytoplasmic bulk flow is the vehicle for nuclear displacement in growing hyphal regions of N. crassa Motors are involved in nuclei saltatory movements in both retrograde or anterograde direction. In the dynein and kinesin mutants, micro and macrovesicles can reach the Spk, although growth is slightly impaired and the Spk displays an erratic path. Hyphal growth requires MTs, and their associated motors are required for their organization and dynamics and Spk integrity.","['Neurospora crassa', 'dynactin', 'dynein', 'kinesin', 'microtubules']",Mycologia,Ensenada B.C. 22860 Mexico rmourino@cicese.mx,2016 May-Jun

34612669,Courtship Ritual of Male and Female Nuclei during Fertilization in Neurospora crassa.,"Sexual reproduction is a key process influencing the evolution and adaptation of animals, plants, and many eukaryotic microorganisms, such as fungi. However, the sequential cell biology of fertilization and the associated nuclear dynamics after plasmogamy are poorly understood in filamentous fungi. Using histone-fluorescent parental isolates, we tracked male and female nuclei during fertilization in the model ascomycete Neurospora crassa using live-cell imaging. This study unravels the behavior of trichogyne resident female nuclei and the extraordinary manner in which male nuclei migrate up the trichogyne to the protoperithecium. Our observations raise new fundamental questions about the modus operandi of nucleus movements during sexual reproduction, male and female nuclear identity, guidance of nuclei within the trichogyne and, unexpectedly, the avoidance of ""polyspermy"" in fungi. The spatiotemporal dynamics of male nuclei within the trichogyne following plasmogamy are also described, where the speed and the deformation of male nuclei are of the most dramatic observed to date in a living organism. IMPORTANCE Using live-cell fluorescence imaging, for the first time we have observed live male and female nuclei during sexual reproduction in the model fungus Neurospora crassa. This study reveals the specific behavior of resident female nuclei within the trichogyne (the female organ) after fertilization and the extraordinary manner in which male nuclei migrate across the trichogyne toward their final destination, the protoperithecium, where karyogamy takes place. Importantly, the speed and deformation of male nuclei were found to be among the most dramatic ever observed in a living organism. Furthermore, we observed that entry of male nuclei into protoperithecia may block the entry of other male nuclei, suggesting that a process analogous to polyspermy avoidance could exist in fungi. Our live-cell imaging approach opens new opportunities for novel research on cell-signaling during sexual reproduction in fungi and, on a broader scale, nuclear dynamics in eukaryotes.","['Neurospora crassa', 'fertilization', 'filamentous fungi', 'fungi', 'live-cell imaging', 'mating', 'nucleus', 'sexual reproduction', 'trichogyne']",Microbiology spectrum,France,2021 Oct 31

29600559,Altering Neurospora crassa MOB2A exposes its functions in development and affects its interaction with the NDR kinase COT1.,"The Neurospora crassa Mps One Binder (MOB) proteins MOB2A and MOB2B physically interact with the Nuclear Dbf2 Related (NDR) kinase COT1 and have been shown to have overlapping functions in various aspects of asexual development. Here, we identified two N. crassa MOB2A residues, Tyr117 and Tyr119, which are potentially phosphorylated. Using phosphomimetic mob-2a mutants we have been able to establish that apart from their previously described roles, MOB2A/B are involved in additional developmental processes. Enhanced conidial germination, accompanied by conidial agglutination, in the phosphomimetic mutants indicated that MOB2A is a negative regulator of germination. Thick-section imaging of perithecia revealed slow maturation and a lack of asci alignment in the mutant strains demonstrating a role for MOB2A in sexual development. We demonstrate that even though MOB2A and MOB2B have some overlapping functions, MOB2B cannot compensate for the roles MOB2A has in conidiation and germination. Altering Tyr residues 117 and 119 impaired the physical interactions between MOB2A and COT1, most likely contributing to some of the observed effects. As cot-1 and the phosphomimetic mutants share an extragenic suppressor (gul-1), we concluded that at least some of the effects imposed by altering Tyr117 and Tyr119 are mediated by the NDR kinase.",?,Molecular microbiology,Israel,2018 Jun

StuA and ASM-1 have roles in asexual (conidiation) and sexual (ascospore formation) development in both organisms. To address the hypothesis that the last common ancestor of these diverse fungi regulated conidiation with similar genes, asm-1 was introduced into the stuA1 mutant of A. nidulans. Expression of asm-1 complemented defective conidiophore morphology and restored conidia production to wild type levels in stuA1. Expression of asm-1 in the stuA1 strain did not rescue the defect in sexual development. When the conidiation regulator AbaA was tagged at its C-terminus with GFP in A. nidulans, it localized to nuclei in phialides. When expressed in the stuA1 mutant, AbaA::GFP localized to nuclei in conidiophores but no longer was confined to phialides, suggesting that expression of AbaA in specific cell types of the conidiophore was conditioned by StuA. Our data suggest that the function in conidiation of StuA and ASM-1 is conserved and support the view that, despite the great morphological and ontogenic diversity of their condiphores, the last common ancestor of A. nidulans and N. crassa produced an ortholog of StuA that was involved in conidiophore development.","['APSES transcription factor', 'conidiation', 'evolution of development (evo-devo)']",Mycologia,Texas 77843,2015 Mar-Apr
35293585,Characterizing the gene-environment interaction underlying natural morphological variation in Neurospora crassa conidiophores using high-throughput phenomics and transcriptomics.,"Neurospora crassa propagates through dissemination of conidia, which develop through specialized structures called conidiophores. Recent work has identified striking variation in conidiophore morphology, using a wild population collection from Louisiana, United States of America to classify 3 distinct phenotypes: Wild-Type, Wrap, and Bulky. Little is known about the impact of these phenotypes on sporulation or germination later in the N. crassa life cycle, or about the genetic variation that underlies them. In this study, we show that conidiophore morphology likely affects colonization capacity of wild N. crassa isolates through both sporulation distance and germination on different carbon sources. We generated and crossed homokaryotic strains belonging to each phenotypic group to more robustly fit a model for and estimate heritability of the complex trait, conidiophore architecture. Our fitted model suggests at least 3 genes and 2 epistatic interactions contribute to conidiophore phenotype, which has an estimated heritability of 0.47. To uncover genes contributing to these phenotypes, we performed RNA-sequencing on mycelia and conidiophores of strains representing each of the 3 phenotypes. Our results show that the Bulky strain had a distinct transcriptional profile from that of Wild-Type and Wrap, exhibiting differential expression patterns in clock-controlled genes (ccgs), the conidiation-specific gene con-6, and genes implicated in metabolism and communication.

In this study, an agmatinase-like protein (AGM-1) (NCU 01348) in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is reported. Purified AGM-1 from N. crassa displays enzymatic activity hydrolyzing agmatine; therefore, it can be considered as an agmatinase-like protein. However, its role in the alternative pathway to produce polyamines apparently is not its main function since only a slight reduction of polyamines concentration was detected in the Deltaagm-1 het strain. Moreover, the null mutant Deltaagm-1 (homokaryon strain) was unable to grow and the deficiency of agm-1 in the heterokaryon strain provoked a decrease in elongation rate, conidia and biomass production, despite of having de constitutive pathway via the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Additionally, mature hyphae of the Deltaagm-1 het strain presented unusual apical branching and a disorganized Spitzenkorper (Spk). Trying to reveal the role of AGM-1in N. crassa, the protein was tagged with GFP and interestingly the dynamics and intracellular localization of AGM-1 closely resembles the F-actin population. This finding was further examined in order to elucidate if AGM-1is in a close association with F-actin. Since polyamines, among them agmatine, have been reported to act as stabilizers of actin filaments, we evaluated in vitro G-actin polymerization in the presence of agmatine and the effect of purified AGM-1 from N. crassa on these polymerized actin filaments. It was found that polymerization of actin filaments increases in the presence of agmatine and the addition of purified AGM-1 from N. crassa depolymerizes these actin filaments. Also, it was determined that an intact substrate binding site of the enzyme is necessary for the localization pattern of the native AGM-1. These results suggest that in N. crassa AGM-1 has a close association with the F-actin population via its substrate agmatine, playing an essential role during cell development.","['Actin', 'Agmatinase', 'Agmatine', 'Cell development', 'N. crassa', 'Polyamines']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2019 Nov
35000560,"Production, purification and characterization of a novel antithrombotic and anticoagulant serine protease from food grade microorganism Neurospora crassa.","A novel thrombolytic enzyme was produced by food grade microorganism Neurospora crassa using agro-industrial by-products as substrates. Process parameters were optimized using Plackett-Berman and Box-Benhken design. Under the optimized fermentation conditions, high fibrinolytic activity of 403.59 U/mL was obtained. It was purified with a specific activity of 3572.4 U/mg by ammonium sulfate precipitation and SP Sepharose chromatography. The molecular weight of the enzyme was approximately 32 kDa. It exhibited maximum activity at 40  degrees C and pH 7.4. Its activity was enhanced by Cu(2+), Na(+), Zn(2+), and completely inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, which indicates it could be a serine protease. The enzyme could degrade fibrin clot directly without the need of plasminogen activator, and effectively cleaved Aalpha, Bbeta, gamma chains of fibrinogen. It could inhibit the formation of blood clots in vitro and acts as an anticoagulant. Compared to heparin the purified enzyme showed extended anticoagulant activity. Blood clots were dissolved effectively and dissolution rate was increased with time. Based on these results, this novel enzyme has the potential to be developed as a thrombolytic agent.","['Cardiovascular diseases', 'Neurospora crassa', 'fermentation', 'fibrinolytic enzyme', 'purification', 'thrombolytic agent']",Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,China,2022
35761233,Light regulates the degradation of the regulatory protein VE-1 in the fungus Neurospora crassa.,"BACKGROUND: Fungi use light as an environmental signal to regulate developmental transitions that are key aspects of their biological cycles and that are also relevant for their dispersal and infectivity as plant or animal pathogens. In addition, light regulates the accumulation of photoprotective pigments, like carotenoids, and other secondary metabolites. Most fungal light responses occur after changes in gene transcription and we describe here a novel effect of light in the regulation of degradation of VE-1, a key component of the velvet complex, in the model fungus Neurospora crassa. The velvet complex is a fungal-specific protein complex that coordinates fungal development, secondary metabolism, and light regulation by interacting with other regulators and photoreceptors and modifying gene expression. RESULTS: We have characterized the role of VE-1 during conidiation in N. crassa. In vegetative mycelia, VE-1 is localized in the cytoplasm and nuclei and is required for light-dependent transcription but does not interact with the photoreceptor and transcription factor WC-1. VE-1 is more stable in light than in darkness during asexual development (conidiation). We have shown that this light effect requires the blue-light photoreceptor WC-1. We have characterized the role of the proteasome, the COP9 signalosome (CSN), and the adaptor component of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, FWD-1, in the degradation of VE-1. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that this new effect of light allows the fungal cell to adapt quickly to changes in light exposure by promoting the accumulation of VE-1 for the regulation of genes that participate in the biosynthesis of photoprotective pigments.","['COP9 signalosome', 'Light regulation', 'Protein degradation', 'Velvet complex']",BMC biology,Spain,2022 Jun 27
35913159,Transcriptional Regulation by the Velvet Protein VE-1 during Asexual Development in the Fungus Neurospora crassa.,"Asexual reproduction in fungi facilitates the dispersal and colonization of new substrates and, in pathogenic fungi, allows infection of plants and animals. The velvet complex is a fungus-specific protein complex that participates in the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental signals like light, as well as developmental processes, pathogenesis, and secondary metabolism. The velvet complex in the fungus Neurospora crassa is composed of three proteins, VE-1, VE-2, and LAE-1. Mutations in ve-1 or ve-2, but not in lae-1, led to shorter heights of aerial tissue, a mixture of aerial hyphae and developing macroconidia, and increased microconidiation when they were combined with mutations in the transcription factor gene fl. VE-2 and LAE-1 were detected during vegetative growth and conidiation, unlike VE-1, which was mostly observed in samples obtained from submerged vegetative hyphae. We propose that VE-1 is the limiting component of the velvet complex during conidiation and has a major role in the transcriptional regulation of conidiation. Characterization of the role of VE-1 during mycelial growth and asexual development (conidiation) by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments allowed the identification of a set of genes regulated by VE-1 that participate in the regulation of conidiation, most notably the transcription factor genes vib-1 and fl. We propose that VE-1 and VE-2 regulate the development of aerial tissue and the balance between macro- and microconidiation in coordination with FL and VIB-1. IMPORTANCE Most fungi disperse in nature and infect new hosts by producing vegetative spores or conidia during asexual development. This is a process that is regulated by environmental signals like light and the availability of nutrients. A protein complex, the velvet complex, participates in the integration of environmental signals to regulate conidiation. We have found that a key component of this complex in the fungus Neurospora crassa, VE-1, has a major role in the regulation of transcription during conidiation. VE-1 regulates a large number of genes, including the genes for the transcription factors FL and VIB-1. Our results will help to understand how environmental signals are integrated in the fungal cell to regulate development.","['RNA-seq', 'conidiation', 'light', 'transcriptional regulation', 'velvet complex']",mBio,Spain,2022 Aug 30
37093794,The structure of prevacuolar compartments in Neurospora crassa as observed with super-resolution microscopy.,"The hyphal tips of Neurospora crassa have prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) of unusual size and shape. They appear to function as late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. PVCs are highly variable in size (1-3 microns) and exhibit rapid changes in structure. When visualized with tagged integral membrane proteins of the vacuole the PVCs appear as ring or horseshoe-shaped structures. Some soluble molecules that fill the lumen of mature spherical vacuoles do not appear in the lumen of the PVC but are seen in the ring or horseshoe-shaped structures. By using super-resolution microscopy I have achieved a better understanding of the structure of the PVCs. The PVC appears to form a pouch with an open end. The walls of the pouch are composed of small vesicles or tubules, approximately 250 nm in diameter. The shape of the PVC can change in a few seconds, caused by the apparent movement of the vesicles/tubules. In approximately 85% of the PVCs dynein and dynactin were observed as poorly defined lumps inside the pouch-shaped PVCs. Within the PVCs they were not attached to microtubules nor did they appear to be in direct contact with the vesicles and tubules that formed the PVCs. In the future, the structure and relatively large size of the Neurospora PVC may allow us to visualize protein-sorting events that occur in the formation of vacuoles.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2023
27172195,Histone H1 Limits DNA Methylation in Neurospora crassa.,"Histone H1 variants, known as linker histones, are essential chromatin components in higher eukaryotes, yet compared to the core histones relatively little is known about their in vivo functions. The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa encodes a single H1 protein that is not essential for viability. To investigate the role of N. crassa H1, we constructed a functional FLAG-tagged H1 fusion protein and performed genomic and molecular analyses. Cell fractionation experiments showed that H1-3XFLAG is a chromatin binding protein. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that H1-3XFLAG is globally enriched throughout the genome with a subtle preference for promoters of expressed genes. In mammals, the stoichiometry of H1 impacts nucleosome repeat length. To determine if H1 impacts nucleosome occupancy or nucleosome positioning in N. crassa, we performed micrococcal nuclease digestion in the wild-type and the [Formula: see text]hH1 strain followed by sequencing (MNase-seq). Deletion of hH1 did not significantly impact nucleosome positioning or nucleosome occupancy. Analysis of DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (MethylC-seq) revealed a modest but global increase in DNA methylation in the [Formula: see text]hH1 mutant. Together, these data suggest that H1 acts as a nonspecific chromatin binding protein that can limit accessibility of the DNA methylation machinery in N. crassa.","['DNA methylation', 'chromatin', 'histone H1', 'nucleosome positioning']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Georgia 30602,2016 Jul 7

23687116,"Neurospora crassa NKIN2, a kinesin-3 motor, transports early endosomes and is required for polarized growth.","Biological motors are molecular nanomachines, which convert chemical energy into mechanical forces. The combination of mechanoenzymes with structural components, such as the cytoskeleton, enables eukaryotic cells to overcome entropy, generate molecular gradients, and establish polarity. Hyphae of filamentous fungi are among the most polarized cells, and polarity defects are most obvious. Here, we studied the role of the kinesin-3 motor, NKIN2, in Neurospora crassa. We found that NKIN2 localizes as fast-moving spots in the cytoplasm of mature hyphae. To test whether the spots represented early endosomes, the Rab5 GTPase YPT52 was used as an endosomal marker. NKIN2 colocalized with YPT52. Deletion of nkin2 caused strongly reduced endosomal movement. Combined, these results confirm the involvement of NKIN2 in early endosome transport. Introduction of a rigor mutation into NKIN2 labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) resulted in decoration of microtubules. Interestingly, NKIN2(rigor) was associated with a subpopulation of microtubules, as had been shown earlier for the Aspergillus nidulans orthologue UncA. Other kinesins did not show this specificity.",?,Eukaryotic cell,Germany,2013 Jul
34385329,Recombination-independent recognition of DNA homology for meiotic silencing in Neurospora crassa.,"The pairing of homologous chromosomes represents a critical step of meiosis in nearly all sexually reproducing species. In many organisms, pairing involves chromosomes that remain apparently intact. The mechanistic nature of homology recognition at the basis of such pairing is unknown. Using ""meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA"" (MSUD) as a model process, we demonstrate the existence of a cardinally different approach to DNA homology recognition in meiosis. The main advantage of MSUD over other experimental systems lies in its ability to identify any relatively short DNA fragment lacking a homologous allelic partner. Here, we show that MSUD does not rely on the canonical mechanism of meiotic recombination, yet it is promoted by REC8, a conserved component of the meiotic cohesion complex. We also show that certain patterns of interspersed homology are recognized as pairable during MSUD. Such patterns need to be colinear and must contain short tracts of sequence identity spaced apart at 21 or 22 base pairs. By using these periodicity values as a guiding parameter in all-atom molecular modeling, we discover that homologous DNA molecules can pair by forming quadruplex-based contacts with an interval of 2.5 helical turns. This process requires right-handed plectonemic coiling and additional conformational changes in the intervening double-helical segments. Our results 1) reconcile genetic and biophysical evidence for the existence of direct homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-dsDNA pairing, 2) identify a role for this process in initiating RNA interference, and 3) suggest that chromosomes can be cross-matched by a precise mechanism that operates on intact dsDNA molecules.","['DNA', 'MSUD', 'Neurospora', 'homology recognition', 'meiosis']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,IL 61761,2021 Aug 17
25361899,A novel cryptochrome-dependent oscillator in Neurospora crassa.,"Several lines of evidence suggest that the circadian clock is constructed of multiple molecular feedback oscillators that function to generate robust rhythms in organisms. However, while core oscillator mechanisms driving specific behaviors are well described in several model systems, the nature of other potential circadian oscillators is not understood. Using genetic approaches in the fungus Neurospora crassa, we uncovered an oscillator mechanism that drives rhythmic spore development in the absence of the well-characterized FRQ/WCC oscillator (FWO) and in constant light, conditions under which the FWO is not functional. While this novel oscillator does not require the FWO for activity, it does require the blue-light photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY); thus, we call it the CRY-dependent oscillator (CDO). The CDO was uncovered in a strain carrying a mutation in cog-1 (cry-dependent oscillator gate-1), has a period of  approximately 1 day in constant light, and is temperature-compensated. In addition, cog-1 cells lacking the circadian blue-light photoreceptor WC-1 respond to blue light, suggesting that alternate light inputs function in cog-1 mutant cells. We show that the blue-light photoreceptors VIVID and CRY compensate for each other and for WC-1 in CRY-dependent oscillator light responses, but that WC-1 is necessary for circadian light entrainment.","['FRQ-WCC oscillator', 'FRQ-less oscillator', 'circadian clock', 'cryptochrome', 'oscillator']",Genetics,Texas 77843,2015 Jan

29050553,Natural Variation of the Circadian Clock in Neurospora.,"Most living organisms on earth experience daily and expected changes from the rotation of the earth. For an organism, the ability to predict and prepare for incoming stresses or resources is a very important skill for survival. This cellular process of measuring daily time of the day is collectively called the circadian clock. Because of its fundamental role in survival in nature, there is a great interest in studying the natural variation of the circadian clock. However, characterizing the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying natural variation of circadian clocks remains a challenging task. In this chapter, we will summarize the progress in studying natural variation of the circadian clock in the successful eukaryotic model Neurospora, which led to discovering many design principles of the molecular mechanisms of the eukaryotic circadian clock. Despite the success of the system in revealing the molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock, Neurospora has not been utilized to extensively study natural variation. We will review the challenges that hindered the natural variation studies in Neurospora, and how they were overcome. We will also review the advantages of Neurospora for natural variation studies. Since Neurospora is the model fungal species for circadian study, it represents over 5 million species of fungi on earth. These fungi play important roles in ecosystems on earth, and as such Neurospora could serve as an important model for understanding the ecological role of natural variation in fungal circadian clocks.","['Adaptation', 'Circadian clocks', 'Ecotypes', 'Natural variation', 'Neurospora']",Advances in genetics,United States,2017
30654952,Characterization of the Neurospora crassa DHN melanin biosynthetic pathway in developing ascospores and peridium cells.,"Neurospora crassa contains all four enzymes for the synthesis of DHN (dihydroxynaphthalene), the substrate for melanin formation. We show that the DHN melanin pathway functions during N. crassa female development to generate melanized peridium and ascospore cell walls. N. crassa contains one polyketide synthase (PER-1), two polyketide hydrolases (PKH-1 and PKH-2), two THN (tetrahydroxynaphthalene) reductases (PKR-1 and PKR-2), and one scytalone dehydratase (SCY-1). We show that the PER-1, PKH-1, PKR-1 and SCY-1 are required for ascospoer melanization. We also identified the laccase that functions in the conversion of DHN into melanin via a free radical oxidative polymerization reaction, and have named the gene lacm-1 (laccase for melanin formation-1). In maturing perithecia, we show that LACM-1 is localized to the peridium cell wall space while the DHN pathway enzymes are localized to intracellular vesicles. We present a model for melanin formation in which melanin is formed within the cell wall space and the cell wall structure is similar to ""reinforced concrete"" with the cell wall glucan, chitin, and glycoproteins encased within the melanin polymer. This arrangement provides for a very strong and resilient cell wall and protects the glucan/chitin/glycoprotein matrix from digestion from enzymes and damage from free radicals.","['Ascomycete', 'Cell wall', 'Fungal melanin', 'Melanin']",Fungal biology,USA,2019 Jan
28429154,Developing elite Neurospora crassa strains for cellulosic ethanol production using fungal breeding.,"The demand for renewable and sustainable energy has generated considerable interest in the conversion of cellulosic biomass into liquid fuels such as ethanol using a filamentous fungus. While attempts have been made to study cellulose metabolism through the use of knock-out mutants, there have been no systematic effort to characterize natural variation for cellulose metabolism in ecotypes adapted to different habitats. Here, we characterized natural variation in saccharification of cellulose and fermentation in 73 ecotypes and 89 laboratory strains of the model fungus Neurospora crassa. We observed significant variation in both traits among natural and laboratory generated populations, with some elite strains performing better than the reference strain. In the F1 population N345, 15% of the population outperformed both parents with the top performing strain having 10% improvement in ethanol production.

32357961,A Light-Inducible Strain for Genome-Wide Histone Turnover Profiling in Neurospora crassa.,"In chromatin, nucleosomes are composed of  approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer, and are highly dynamic structures subject to remodeling and exchange. Histone turnover has previously been implicated in various processes including the regulation of chromatin accessibility, segregation of chromatin domains, and dilution of histone marks. Histones in different chromatin environments may turnover at different rates, possibly with functional consequences. Neurospora crassa sports a chromatin environment that is more similar to that of higher eukaryotes than yeasts, which have been utilized in the past to explore histone exchange. We constructed a simple light-inducible system to profile histone exchange in N. crassa on a 3xFLAG-tagged histone H3 under the control of the rapidly inducible vvd promoter. After induction with blue light, incorporation of tagged H3 into chromatin occurred within 20 min. Previous studies of histone turnover involved considerably longer incubation periods and relied on a potentially disruptive change of medium for induction. We used this reporter to explore replication-independent histone turnover at genes and examine changes in histone turnover at heterochromatin domains in different heterochromatin mutant strains. In euchromatin, H3-3xFLAG patterns were almost indistinguishable from that observed in wild-type in all mutant backgrounds tested, suggesting that loss of heterochromatin machinery has little effect on histone turnover in euchromatin. However, turnover at heterochromatin domains increased with loss of trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 or HP1, but did not depend on DNA methylation. Our reporter strain provides a simple yet powerful tool to assess histone exchange across multiple chromatin contexts.","['Neurospora crassa heterochromatin', 'chromatin profiling', 'histone exchange', 'light induction']",Genetics,Oregon 97403,2020 Jul
33333093,Functional analyses of xylanolytic enzymes involved in xylan degradation and utilization in Neurospora crassa.,"Neurospora crassa possesses six putative xylanases and four putative xylosidases. qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of all these xylanolytic enzymes was induced by xylan. Except for two intracellular beta-xylosidases, others were shown to be secreted enzymes based on the localization analysis of EGFP-fusion proteins. Among them, GH10-1, GH10-2, GH11-1, and GH11-2 were successfully expressed and characterized as typical endo-beta-1,4-xylanases that hydrolyze the xylooligosaccharides with a polymeric degree not less than three or four. Strains deleted for either gh10-1, gh10-2, gh3-7, or gh3-8 displayed decreased growth in xylan and biomass media. Disruption of gh3-7 or gh43-1 resulted in enhanced-xylanolytic enzyme activity when cultivated in biomass medium. Collectively, these results suggest that xylooligosaccharides released by the actions of xylanases and xylosidases not only serve as the carbon sources to maintain the growth of N. crassa, but they also act as inducers to trigger the expression of hydrolytic enzymes in vivo.","['Biomass degradation', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Physiological function', 'Xylanase']",International journal of biological macromolecules,Japan,2021 Feb 1
33792687,A global search for novel transcription factors impacting the Neurospora crassa circadian clock.,"Eukaryotic circadian oscillators share a common circuit architecture, a negative feedback loop in which a positive element activates the transcription of a negative one that then represses the action of the former, inhibiting its own expression. While studies in mammals and insects have revealed additional transcriptional inputs modulating the expression of core clock components, this has been less characterized in the model Neurospora crassa, where the participation of other transcriptional components impacting circadian clock dynamics remains rather unexplored. Thus, we sought to identify additional transcriptional regulators modulating the N. crassa clock, following a reverse genetic screen based on luminescent circadian reporters and a collection of transcription factors (TFs) knockouts, successfully covering close to 60% of them. Besides the canonical core clock components WC-1 and -2, none of the tested transcriptional regulators proved to be essential for rhythmicity. Nevertheless, we identified a set of 23 TFs that when absent lead to discrete, but significant, changes in circadian period. While the current level of analysis does not provide mechanistic information about how these new players modulate circadian parameters, the results of this screen reveal that an important number of light and clock-regulated TFs, involved in a plethora of processes, are capable of modulating the clockworks. This partial reverse genetic clock screen also exemplifies how the N. crassa knockout collection continues to serve as an expedite platform to address broad biological questions.","['Neurospora crassa', 'circadian clock', 'luciferase', 'reverse genetic screen', 'transcription factors']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Chile,2021 Jun 17
34613755,Quantifying Oxidation of Cellulose-Associated Glucuronoxylan by Two Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases from Neurospora crassa.,"Family AA9 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are abundant in fungi, where they catalyze oxidative depolymerization of recalcitrant plant biomass. These AA9 LPMOs cleave cellulose and some also act on hemicelluloses, primarily other (substituted) beta-(1-->4)-glucans. Oxidative cleavage of xylan has been shown for only a few AA9 LPMOs, and it remains unclear whether this activity is a minor side reaction or primary function. Here, we show that Neurospora crassa LPMO9F (NcLPMO9F) and the phylogenetically related, hitherto uncharacterized NcLPMO9L from N. crassa are active on both cellulose and cellulose-associated glucuronoxylan but not on glucuronoxylan alone. A newly developed method for simultaneous quantification of xylan-derived and cellulose-derived oxidized products showed that NcLPMO9F preferentially cleaves xylan when acting on a cellulose-beechwood glucuronoxylan mixture, yielding about three times more xylan-derived than cellulose-derived oxidized products. Interestingly, under similar conditions, NcLPMO9L and the previously characterized McLPMO9H, from Malbranchea cinnamomea, showed different xylan-to-cellulose preferences, giving oxidized product ratios of about 0.5:1 and 1:1, respectively, indicative of functional variation among xylan-active LPMOs. Phylogenetic and structural analysis of xylan-active AA9 LPMOs led to the identification of characteristic structural features, including unique features that do not occur in phylogenetically remote AA9 LPMOs, such as four AA9 LPMOs whose lack of activity toward glucuronoxylan was demonstrated in the present study. Taken together, the results provide a path toward discovery of additional xylan-active LPMOs and show that the huge family of AA9 LPMOs has members that preferentially act on xylan. These findings shed new light on the biological role and industrial potential of these fascinating enzymes. IMPORTANCE Plant cell wall polysaccharides are highly resilient to depolymerization by hydrolytic enzymes, partly due to cellulose chains being tightly packed in microfibrils that are covered by hemicelluloses. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) seem well suited to attack these resilient copolymeric structures, but the occurrence and importance of hemicellulolytic activity among LPMOs remain unclear. Here, we show that certain AA9 LPMOs preferentially cleave xylan when acting on a cellulose-glucuronoxylan mixture, and that this ability is the result of protein evolution that has resulted in a clade of AA9 LPMOs with specific structural features. Our findings strengthen the notion that the vast arsenal of AA9 LPMOs in certain fungal species provides functional versatility and that AA9 LPMOs may have evolved to promote oxidative depolymerization of a wide variety of recalcitrant, copolymeric plant polysaccharide structures. These findings have implications for understanding the biological roles and industrial potential of LPMOs.","['LPMO', 'Neurospora crassa', 'glucuronoxylan', 'hemicellulose', 'lignocellulose', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases', 'xylan']",Applied and environmental microbiology,Norway,2021 Nov 24
35638725,"Secondary Metabolism Gene Clusters Exhibit Increasingly Dynamic and Differential Expression during Asexual Growth, Conidiation, and Sexual Development in Neurospora crassa.","Secondary metabolite clusters (SMCs) encode the machinery for fungal toxin production. However, understanding their function and analyzing their products requires investigation of the developmental and environmental conditions in which they are expressed. Gene expression is often restricted to specific and unexamined stages of the life cycle. Therefore, we applied comparative genomics analyses to identify SMCs in Neurospora crassa and analyzed extensive transcriptomic data spanning nine independent experiments from diverse developmental and environmental conditions to reveal their life cycle-specific gene expression patterns. We reported 20 SMCs comprising 177 genes-a manageable set for investigation of the roles of SMCs across the life cycle of the fungal model N. crassa-as well as gene sets coordinately expressed in 18 predicted SMCs during asexual and sexual growth under three nutritional and two temperature conditions. Divergent activity of SMCs between asexual and sexual development was reported. Of 126 SMC genes that we examined for knockout phenotypes, al-2 and al-3 exhibited phenotypes in asexual growth and conidiation, whereas os-5, poi-2, and pmd-1 exhibited phenotypes in sexual development. SMCs with annotated function in mating and crossing were actively regulated during the switch between asexual and sexual growth. Our discoveries call for attention to roles that SMCs may play in the regulatory switches controlling mode of development, as well as the ecological associations of those developmental stages that may influence expression of SMCs. IMPORTANCE Secondary metabolites (SMs) are low-molecular-weight compounds that often mediate interactions between fungi and their environments. Fungi enriched with SMs are of significant research interest to agriculture and medicine, especially from the aspects of pathogen ecology and environmental epidemiology. However, SM clusters (SMCs) that have been predicted by comparative genomics alone have typically been poorly defined and insufficiently functionally annotated. Therefore, we have investigated coordinate expression in SMCs in the model system N. crassa, and our results suggest that SMCs respond to environmental signals and to stress that are associated with development. This study examined SMC regulation at the level of RNA to integrate observations and knowledge of these genes in various growth and development conditions, supporting combining comparative genomics and inclusive transcriptomics to improve computational annotation of SMCs. Our findings call for detailed study of the function of SMCs during the asexual-sexual switch, a key, often-overlooked developmental stage.","['Neurospora crassa', 'asexual development', 'environmental microbiology', 'filamentous fungi', 'gene cluster', 'secondary metabolism', 'sexual development', 'transcriptomics']",mSystems,USA,2022 Jun 28
30222964,Modeling the crosstalk between the circadian clock and ROS in Neurospora crassa.,"The circadian clock regulates the expression of clock-controlled genes and adapts to environmental changes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) also undergo circadian rhythms and have a role in circadian timekeeping. To elucidate crosstalk between ROS and the circadian clock in Neurospora crassa, we build an integrative network model, characterizing the circadian oscillator, ROS system and their interactions. Notably, the (de)phosphorylation and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of clock proteins are modeled in detail. Simulation results quantitatively reproduce the essential features of circadian rhythm (both in constant darkness and under light/dark cycles) and the changes in period length and phase when ROS levels are altered under diverse conditions. This work clarifies the effects of three interactions between ROS and the clock on the circadian rhythm, suggesting that the regulation of WCC activity by protein phosphatase 2A in an O(2)(-)-dependent manner plays a predominant role.

25333968,"Neurospora crassa female development requires the PACC and other signal transduction pathways, transcription factors, chromatin remodeling, cell-to-cell fusion, and autophagy.","Using a screening protocol we have identified 68 genes that are required for female development in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We find that we can divide these genes into five general groups: 1) Genes encoding components of the PACC signal transduction pathway, 2) Other signal transduction pathway genes, including genes from the three N. crassa MAP kinase pathways, 3) Transcriptional factor genes, 4) Autophagy genes, and 5) Other miscellaneous genes. Complementation and RIP studies verified that these genes are needed for the formation of the female mating structure, the protoperithecium, and for the maturation of a fertilized protoperithecium into a perithecium. Perithecia grafting experiments demonstrate that the autophagy genes and the cell-to-cell fusion genes (the MAK-1 and MAK-2 pathway genes) are needed for the mobilization and movement of nutrients from an established vegetative hyphal network into the developing protoperithecium. Deletion mutants for the PACC pathway genes palA, palB, palC, palF, palH, and pacC were found to be defective in two aspects of female development. First, they were unable to initiate female development on synthetic crossing medium. However, they could form protoperithecia when grown on cellophane, on corn meal agar, or in response to the presence of nearby perithecia. Second, fertilized perithecia from PACC pathway mutants were unable to produce asci and complete female development. Protein localization experiments with a GFP-tagged PALA construct showed that PALA was localized in a peripheral punctate pattern, consistent with a signaling center associated with the ESCRT complex. The N. crassa PACC signal transduction pathway appears to be similar to the PacC/Rim101 pathway previously characterized in Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In N. crassa the pathway plays a key role in regulating female development.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2014
34006661,Circadian Clock Control of Translation Initiation Factor eIF2alpha Activity Requires eIF2gamma-Dependent Recruitment of Rhythmic PPP-1 Phosphatase in Neurospora crassa.,"The circadian clock controls the phosphorylation and activity of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). In Neurospora crassa, the clock drives a daytime peak in the activity of the eIF2alpha kinase CPC-3, the homolog of yeast and mammalian GCN2 kinase. This leads to increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2alpha (P-eIF2alpha) and reduced mRNA translation initiation during the day. We hypothesized that rhythmic eIF2alpha activity also requires dephosphorylation of P-eIF2alpha at night by phosphatases. In support of this hypothesis, we show that mutation of N. crassa PPP-1, a homolog of the yeast eIF2alpha phosphatase GLC7, leads to high and arrhythmic P-eIF2alpha levels, while maintaining core circadian oscillator function. PPP-1 levels are clock-controlled, peaking in the early evening, and rhythmic PPP-1 levels are necessary for rhythmic P-eIF2alpha accumulation. Deletion of the N terminus of N. crassa eIF2gamma, the region necessary for eIF2gamma interaction with GLC7 in yeast, led to high and arrhythmic P-eIF2alpha levels. These data supported that N. crassa eIF2gamma functions to recruit PPP-1 to dephosphorylate eIF2alpha at night. Thus, in addition to the activity of CPC-3 kinase, circadian clock regulation of eIF2alpha activity requires dephosphorylation by PPP-1 phosphatase at night. These data show how the circadian clock controls the activity a central regulator of translation, critical for cellular metabolism and growth control, through the temporal coordination of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events.IMPORTANCE Circadian clock control of mRNA translation contributes to the daily cycling of a significant proportion of the cellular protein synthesis, but how this is accomplished is not understood. We discovered that the clock in the model fungus Neurospora crassa regulates rhythms in protein synthesis by controlling the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a conserved translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. During the day, N. crassa eIF2alpha is phosphorylated and inactivated by CPC-3 kinase. At night, a clock-controlled phosphatase, PPP-1, dephosphorylates and activates eIF2alpha, leading to increased nighttime protein synthesis. Translation requires significant cellular energy; thus, partitioning translation to the night by the clock provides a mechanism to coordinate energy metabolism with protein synthesis and cellular growth.","['Neurospora crassa', 'PPP-1', 'circadian clock', 'eIF2alpha', 'eIF2gamma', 'phosphatase', 'translation initiation']",mBio,USA,2021 May 18
28743272,Establishment of Neurospora crassa as a host for heterologous protein production using a human antibody fragment as a model product.,"BACKGROUND: Filamentous fungi are commonly used as production hosts for bulk enzymes in biotechnological applications. Their robust and quick growth combined with their ability to secrete large amounts of protein directly into the culture medium makes fungi appealing organisms for the generation of novel production systems. The red bread mold Neurospora crassa has long been established as a model system in basic research. It can be very easily genetically manipulated and a wealth of molecular tools and mutants are available. In addition, N. crassa is very fast growing and non-toxic. All of these features point to a high but so far untapped potential of this fungus for biotechnological applications. In this study, we used genetic engineering and bioprocess development in a design-build-test-cycle process to establish N. crassa as a production host for heterologous proteins. RESULTS: The human antibody fragment HT186-D11 was fused to a truncated version of the endogenous enzyme glucoamylase (GLA-1), which served as a carrier protein to achieve secretion into the culture medium. A modular expression cassette was constructed and tested under the control of different promoters. Protease activity was identified as a major limitation of the production strain, and the effects of different mutations causing protease deficiencies were compared. Furthermore, a parallel bioreactor system (1 L) was employed to develop and optimize a production process, including the comparison of different culture media and cultivation parameters. After successful optimization of the production strain and the cultivation conditions an exemplary scale up to a 10 L stirred tank reactor was performed. CONCLUSIONS: The data of this study indicate that N. crassa is suited for the production and secretion of heterologous proteins. Controlling expression by the optimized promoter Pccg1nr in a fourfold protease deletion strain resulted in the successful secretion of the heterologous product with estimated yields of 3 mg/L of the fusion protein. The fungus could easily be cultivated in bioreactors and a first scale-up was successful. The system holds therefore much potential, warranting further efforts in optimization.","['Antibody fragments', 'Bioreactor', 'Fusion protein', 'Heterologous proteins', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Proteases']",Microbial cell factories,Germany,2017 Jul 25
32873602,Selection and Characterization of Mutants Defective in DNA Methylation in Neurospora crassa.,"DNA methylation, a prototypical epigenetic modification implicated in gene silencing, occurs in many eukaryotes and plays a significant role in the etiology of diseases such as cancer. The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa places DNA methylation at regions of constitutive heterochromatin such as in centromeres and in other A:T-rich regions of the genome, but this modification is dispensable for normal growth and development. This and other features render N. crassa an excellent model to genetically dissect elements of the DNA methylation pathway. We implemented a forward genetic selection on a massive scale, utilizing two engineered antibiotic-resistance genes silenced by DNA methylation, to isolate mutants d efective i n m ethylation (dim). Hundreds of potential mutants were characterized, yielding a rich collection of informative alleles of 11 genes important for DNA methylation, most of which were already reported. In parallel, we characterized the pairwise interactions in nuclei of the DCDC, the only histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase complex in Neurospora, including those between the DIM-5 catalytic subunit and other complex members. We also dissected the N- and C-termini of the key protein DIM-7, required for DIM-5 histone methyltransferase localization and activation. Lastly, we identified two alleles of a novel gene, dim-10 - a homolog of Clr5 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe - that is not essential for DNA methylation, but is necessary for repression of the antibiotic-resistance genes used in the selection, which suggests that both DIM-10 and DNA methylation promote silencing of constitutive heterochromatin.","['H3K9me3', 'Neurospora', 'cytosine methylation', 'epigenetics', 'heterochromatin']",Genetics,Oregon 97403,2020 Nov
36774527,Effect of itaconic acid production on Neurospora crassa in consolidated bioprocessing of cellulose.,"A system for itaconic acid synthesis from cellulose by Neurospora crassa was established, resulting in the highest yield of itaconic acid was 354.08 + 35.99 mg/L. Meanwhile, cellulase activity increased significantly, without any strain modifications for improved cellulase production. Multi-omics analyses showed that itaconic acid synthesis reduced energy production, leading to decreases in trehalose, cell wall, fatty acids synthesis and downregulations in MAPK signaling pathway, cell cycle and meiosis. More importantly, the low-energy environment enhanced the energy-efficient cellobionic acid/gluconic acid pathway, and the cellulase composition also changed significantly, manifested as the up-regulation of LPMOs and the down-regulation of beta-glucosidases. Enhancing LPMOs-cellobionic acid/gluconic acid system has the potential to reduce energy consumption of the consolidated bioprocessing. These findings offer an overview of resource allocations by N. crassa in response to itaconic acid synthesis and highlight a series of intriguing connections between itaconic acid synthesis and cellulase synthesis in consolidated bioprocessing.","['Cellulase', 'Consolidated bioprocessing', 'Itaconic acid', 'Lignocellulose', 'Neurospora crassa']",Microbial cell factories,China,2023 Feb 11
33138786,Clustering analysis of large-scale phenotypic data in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.,"BACKGROUND: With 9730 protein-coding genes and a nearly complete gene knockout strain collection, Neurospora crassa is a major model organism for filamentous fungi. Despite this abundance of information, the phenotypes of these gene knockout mutants have not been categorized to determine whether there are broad correlations between phenotype and any genetic features. RESULTS: Here, we analyze data for 10 different growth or developmental phenotypes that have been obtained for 1168 N. crassa knockout mutants. Of these mutants, 265 (23%) are in the normal range, while 903 (77%) possess at least one mutant phenotype. With the exception of unclassified functions, the distribution of functional categories for genes in the mutant dataset mirrors that of the N. crassa genome. In contrast, most genes do not possess a yeast ortholog, suggesting that our analysis will reveal functions that are not conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To leverage the phenotypic data to identify pathways, we used weighted Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) approach with 40 clusters. We found that genes encoding metabolic, transmembrane and protein phosphorylation-related genes are concentrated in subsets of clusters. Results from K-Means clustering of transcriptomic datasets showed that most phenotypic clusters contain multiple expression profiles, suggesting that co-expression is not generally observed for genes with shared phenotypes. Analysis of yeast orthologs of genes that co-clustered in MAPK signaling cascades revealed potential networks of interacting proteins in N. crassa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that clustering analysis of phenotypes is a promising tool for generating new hypotheses regarding involvement of genes in cellular pathways in N. crassa. Furthermore, information about gene clusters identified in N. crassa should be applicable to other filamentous fungi, including saprobes and pathogens.","['Functional genomics', 'Fungal genetics', 'Hierarchical clustering', 'Neurospora', 'Phenotypic analysis']",BMC genomics,USA,2020 Nov 2
25914160,Enzymatic characterization of recombinant nitrate reductase expressed and purified from Neurospora crassa.,"We established an expression and purification procedure for recombinant protein production in Neurospora crassa (N. crassa). This Strep-tag(R) based system was successfully used for purifying recombinant N. crassa nitrate reductase (NR), whose enzymatic activity was compared to recombinant N. crassa NR purified from Escherichia coli. The purity of the two different NR preparations was similar but NR purified from N. crassa showed a significantly higher nitrate turnover rate. Two phosphorylation sites were identified for NR purified from the endogenous expression system. We conclude that homologous expression of N. crassa NR yields a higher active enzyme and propose that NR phosphorylation causes enhanced enzymatic activity.","['Neurospora crassa', 'Nitrate reductase', 'Post-translational modification', 'Recombinant protein expression', 'Strep-tag(R)']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Germany,2015 Jul
26031221,Suppressing the Neurospora crassa circadian clock while maintaining light responsiveness in continuous stirred tank reactors.,"Neurospora crassa has been utilized as a model organism for studying biological, regulatory, and circadian rhythms for over 50 years. These circadian cycles are driven at the molecular level by gene transcription events to prepare for environmental changes. N. crassa is typically found on woody biomass and is commonly studied on agar-containing medium which mimics its natural environment. We report a novel method for disrupting circadian gene transcription while maintaining light responsiveness in N. crassa when held in a steady metabolic state using bioreactors. The arrhythmic transcription of core circadian genes and downstream clock-controlled genes was observed in constant darkness (DD) as determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Nearly all core circadian clock genes were up-regulated upon exposure to light during 11hr light/dark cycle experiments under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that the natural timing of the robust circadian clock in N. crassa can be disrupted in the dark when maintained in a consistent metabolic state. Thus, these data lead to a path for the production of industrial scale enzymes in the model system, N. crassa, by removing the endogenous negative feedback regulation by the circadian oscillator.",?,Scientific reports,USA,2015 Jun 2
31664711,Regulation of the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-sensing riboswitch in NMT1 mRNA from Neurospora crassa.,"The expression of Neurospora crassa NMT1 involved in thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) metabolism is regulated at the level of mRNA splicing by a TPP-sensing riboswitch within the precursor NMT1 mRNA. Here, using the systematic helix-based computational method, we investigated the regulation of this riboswitch. We find that the function of the riboswitch does not depend on the transcription process. Whether TPP is present or not, the riboswitch predominately folds into the ON state, while the OFF state aptamer structure does not appear during transcription. Since the transition from the ON state to the aptamer structure is extremely slow, TPP may interact with the RNA before full formation of the aptamer structure, promoting the switch flipping. The potential to fully form helix P0 of the ON state is necessary to restore ligand-dependent gene control by the riboswitch.","['TPP riboswitch', 'cotranscriptional folding', 'gene regulation']",FEBS letters,China,2020 Feb
24260473,Neurospora crassa protein arginine methyl transferases are involved in growth and development and interact with the NDR kinase COT1.,"The protein arginine methyltransferaseas (PRMTs) family is conserved from yeast to human, and regulates stability, localization and activity of proteins. We have characterized deletion strains corresponding to genes encoding for PRMT1/3/5 (designated amt-1, amt-3 and skb-1, respectively) in Neurospora crassa. Deletion of PRMT-encoding genes conferred altered Arg-methylated protein profiles, as determined immunologically. Deltaamt-1 exhibited reduced hyphal elongation rates (70% of wild type) and increased susceptibility to the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor voriconazole. In triangle upamt-3, distances between branches were significantly longer than the wild type, suggesting this gene is required for proper regulation of hyphal branching. Deletion of skb-1 resulted in hyper conidiation (2-fold of the wild type) and increased tolerance to the chitin synthase inhibitor polyoxin D. Inactivation of two Type I PRMTs (amt-1 and amt-3) conferred changes in both asymmetric as well as symmetric protein methylation profiles, suggesting either common substrates and/or cross-regulation of different PRMTs. The PRMTs in N. crassa apparently share cellular pathways which were previously reported to be regulated by the NDR (Nuclear DBF2-related) kinase COT1. Using co-immunprecipitation experiments (with MYC-tagged proteins), we have shown that SKB1 and COT1 physically interacted and the abundance of the 75 kDa MYC::COT1 isoform was increased in a Deltaskb-1 background. On the basis of immunological detection, we propose the possible involvement of PRMTs in Arg-methylation of COT1.",?,PloS one,Israel,2013
29054975,Nuclear transport of the Neurospora crassa NIT-2 transcription factor is mediated by importin-alpha.,"The Neurospora crassa NIT-2 transcription factor belongs to the GATA transcription factor family and plays a fundamental role in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism. Because NIT-2 acts by accessing DNA inside the nucleus, understanding the nuclear import process of NIT-2 is necessary to characterize its function. Thus, in the present study, NIT-2 nuclear transport was investigated using a combination of biochemical, cellular, and biophysical methods. A complemented strain that produced an sfGFP-NIT-2 fusion protein was constructed, and nuclear localization assessments were made under conditions that favored protein translocation to the nucleus. Nuclear translocation was also investigated using HeLa cells, which showed that the putative NIT-2 nuclear localization sequence (NLS; (915)TISSKRQRRHSKS(927)) was recognized by importin-alpha and that subsequent transport occurred via the classical import pathway. The interaction between the N. crassa importin-alpha (NcImpalpha) and the NIT-2 NLS was quantified with calorimetric assays, leading to the observation that the peptide bound to two sites with different affinities, which is typical of a monopartite NLS sequence. The crystal structure of the NcImpalpha/NIT-2 NLS complex was solved and revealed that the NIT-2 peptide binds to NcImpalpha with the major NLS-binding site playing a primary role. This result contrasts other recent studies that suggested a major role for the minor NLS-binding site in importin-alpha from the alpha2 family, indicating that both sites can be used for different cargo proteins according to specific metabolic requirements.","['Neurospora crassa', 'nuclear protein transport', 'regulation of nitrogen metabolism', 'transcription factors']",The Biochemical journal,Brazil,2017 Dec 6
30225531,Consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass to itaconic acid by metabolically engineering Neurospora crassa.,"Neurospora crassa is a filamentous fungus potent in secreting cellulase and degrading lignocellulosic materials. Here, heterologous cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase was expressed in N. crassa to synthesize itaconic acid which is a high potential platform chemical with applications as an alternative for petroleum-based products. The present study demonstrated that itaconic acid can be produced directly from cellulose and other lignocellulosic materials by the engineered strain, with the highest production of 20.414 +/- 0.674 mg/L. The multivariate data analysis methods were used in the parameter analysis of the conversion process. It was found by the hot map analysis that itaconic acid production can promote the secretion of cellulase in N. crassa. Principal component analysis suggested that itaconic acid production was closely related to the concentration of the glucose degraded from lignocelluloses, indicating that the secretion of cellulase is key to the direct conversion of cellulose to itaconic acid in the engineered N. crassa. This work demonstrates that N. crassa could be considered as a new platform in the application of cellulose conversion to itaconic acid.","['Cellulase', 'Heterologous expression', 'Itaconic acid', 'Lignocellulose', 'Neurospora crassa']",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,China,2018 Nov
28600326,Up-Frameshift Protein UPF1 Regulates Neurospora crassa Circadian and Diurnal Growth Rhythms.,"Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a crucial post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that recognizes and eliminates aberrantly processed transcripts, and mediates the expression of normal gene transcripts. In this study, we report that in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the NMD factors play a conserved role in regulating the surveillance of NMD targets including premature termination codon (PTC)-containing transcripts and normal transcripts. The circadian rhythms in all of the knockout strains of upf1-3 genes, which encode the Up-frameshift proteins, were aberrant. The upf1 knockout strain displays a shortened circadian period, which can be restored by constantly expressing exogenous Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). UPF1 regulates the circadian clock by modulating the splicing of the core clock gene frequency (frq) through spliceosome and spliceosome-related arginine/serine-rich splicing factors, which partly account for the short periods in the upf1 knockout strain. We also demonstrated that the clock genes including White Collar (WC)-1, WC-2, and FRQ are involved in controlling the diurnal growth rhythm, and UPF1 may affect the growth rhythms by mediating the FRQ protein levels in the daytime. These findings suggest that the NMD factors play important roles in regulating the circadian clock and diurnal growth rhythms in Neurospora.","['NMD', 'Neurospora crassa', 'alternative splicing', 'circadian clock', 'diurnal rhythm', 'frq']",Genetics,China,2017 Aug
33276093,Biochemical characterization of the dicing activity of Dicer-like 2 in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.,"Dicing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small RNA is an essential process to trigger transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing. Using cell-free extracts of the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, we successfully detected the dicing activity of one of two N. crassa Dicers NcDCL2. The predominant 23-nucleotide (nt) cleavage product was always detected from 30-nt to 130-nt dsRNA substrates, and additional products of approximately 18 to 28 nt were occasionally produced. The enzymatic properties of NcDCL2 are different from those of insect and plant small interfering RNA (siRNA)-producing Dicers, Drosophila melanogaster Dicer-2 and Arabidopsis thaliana DCL3 and DCL4 (AtDCL3 and AtDCL4). Whereas AtDCL3 and AtDCL4 preferentially cleave short and long dsRNAs, respectively, NcDCL2 cleaved both short and long dsRNAs. These results suggest that N. crassa has a single siRNA-producing Dicer NcDCL2, which is a prototype of plant siRNA-producing Dicers with distinct functions in diverse RNA silencing pathways. The dicing assay reported here is convenient to detect and biochemically characterize the dicing activities of both plant and fungal Dicers, and is likely applicable to other organisms.","['DCL2', 'Dicer', 'Dicing assay', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Small RNA']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,USA,2021 Jan
28736299,"N-acetylglucosamine, the building block of chitin, inhibits growth of Neurospora crassa.","N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is the monomer of the polysaccharide chitin, an essential structural component of the fungal cell wall and the arthropod exoskeleton. We recently showed that the genes encoding the enzymes for GlcNAc catabolism are clustered in several ascomycetes. In the present study we tested these fungi for growth on GlcNAc and chitin. All fungi, containing the GlcNAc gene cluster, could grow on GlcNAc with the exception of four independent Neurospora crassa wild-type isolates, which were however able to grow on chitin. GlcNAc even inhibited their growth in the presence of other carbon sources. Genes involved in GlcNAc catabolism were strongly upregulated in the presence of GlcNAc, but during growth on chitin their expression was not increased. Deletion of hxk-3 (encoding the first catabolic enzyme, GlcNAc-hexokinase) and ngt-1 (encoding the GlcNAc transporter) improved growth of N. crassa on GlcNAc in the presence of glycerol. A crucial step in GlcNAc catabolism is enzymatic conversion from glucosamine-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase, DAM-1. To assess, if DAM-1 is compromised in N. crassa, the orthologue from Trichoderma reesei, Trdam1, was expressed in N. crassa. Trdam1 expression partially alleviated the negative effects of GlcNAc in the presence of a second carbon source, but did not fully restore growth on GlcNAc. Our results indicate that the GlcNAc-catabolism pathway is bypassed during growth of N. crassa on chitin by use of an alternative pathway, emphasizing the different strategies that have evolved in the fungal kingdom for chitin utilization.","['Chitin', 'Gene cluster', 'GlcNAc catabolism', 'N-acetylglucosamine', 'Neurospora crassa']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Austria,2017 Oct
32546205,Repeat-induced point mutation in Neurospora crassa causes the highest known mutation rate and mutational burden of any cellular life.,"BACKGROUND: Repeat-induced point (RIP) mutation in Neurospora crassa degrades transposable elements by targeting repeats with C-->T mutations. Whether RIP affects core genomic sequence in important ways is unknown. RESULTS: By parent-offspring whole genome sequencing, we estimate a mutation rate (3.38 x  10(-6) per bp per generation) that is two orders of magnitude higher than reported for any non-viral organism, with 93-98% of mutations being RIP-associated. RIP mutations are, however, relatively rare in coding sequence, in part because RIP preferentially attacks GC-poor long duplicates that interact in three dimensional space, while coding sequence duplicates are rare, GC-rich, short, and tend not to interact. Despite this, with over 5 coding sequence mutations per genome per generation, the mutational burden is an order of magnitude higher than the previously highest observed. Unexpectedly, the majority of these coding sequence mutations appear not to be the direct product of RIP being mostly in non-duplicate sequence and predominantly not C-->T mutations. Nonetheless, RIP-deficient strains have over an order of magnitude fewer coding sequence mutations outside of duplicated domains than RIP-proficient strains. CONCLUSIONS: Neurospora crassa has the highest mutation rate and mutational burden of any non-viral life. While the high rate is largely due to the action of RIP, the mutational burden appears to be RIP-associated but not directly caused by RIP.","['Mutational burden', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Repeat-induced point (RIP) mutation', 'Resequencing']",Genome biology,China,2020 Jun 16
24344125,Evidence for transceptor function of cellodextrin transporters in Neurospora crassa.,"Neurospora crassa colonizes burnt grasslands and metabolizes both cellulose and hemicellulose from plant cell walls. When switched from a favored carbon source to cellulose, N. crassa dramatically up-regulates expression and secretion of genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes. However, the means by which N. crassa and other filamentous fungi sense the presence of cellulose in the environment remains unclear. Previously, we have shown that a N. crassa mutant carrying deletions of three beta-glucosidase enzymes (Delta3betaG) lacks beta-glucosidase activity, but efficiently induces cellulase gene expression and cellulolytic activity in the presence of cellobiose as the sole carbon source. These observations indicate that cellobiose, or a modified version of cellobiose, functions as an inducer of lignocellulolytic gene expression and activity in N. crassa. Here, we show that in N. crassa, two cellodextrin transporters, CDT-1 and CDT-2, contribute to cellulose sensing. A N. crassa mutant carrying deletions for both transporters is unable to induce cellulase gene expression in response to crystalline cellulose. Furthermore, a mutant lacking genes encoding both the beta-glucosidase enzymes and cellodextrin transporters (Delta3betaGDelta2T) does not induce cellulase gene expression in response to cellobiose. Point mutations that severely reduce cellobiose transport by either CDT-1 or CDT-2 when expressed individually do not greatly impact cellobiose induction of cellulase gene expression. These data suggest that the N. crassa cellodextrin transporters act as ""transceptors"" with dual functions - cellodextrin transport and receptor signaling that results in downstream activation of cellulolytic gene expression. Similar mechanisms of transceptor activity likely occur in related ascomycetes used for industrial cellulase production.","['Bioenergy', 'Biofuel', 'Cellodextrin Transporter', 'Cellulase', 'Fungi', 'Genetics', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Transceptor']",The Journal of biological chemistry,From the Departments of Molecular and Cell Biology,2014 Jan 31

To address the first of these we have identified genes that are optimal for use as reference genes in RT-PCR across a wide range of expression levels; the mRNA/transcripts from these genes have potential for use as reference noncycling transcripts outside of Neurospora. In addition, we have generated a genome-wide set of RT-PCR primers, thereby streamlining the analysis of gene expression.

30959095,The role of GYP-3 in cellular morphogenesis of Neurospora crassa: Analyzing its relationship with the polarisome.,"In fungal hyphae multiple protein complexes assemble at sites of apical growth to maintain cell polarity. The polarisome, which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of Spa2, Pea2, Bud6 and Bni1 is described as a small network of functionally related proteins that regulate polarized growth. In yeast Msb3 and Msb4 are considered polarisome components since both proteins interact directly with Spa2 and are involved in Bni1-nucleated actin assembly in vivo. Additionally they regulate exocytosis through their GAP activity towards Sec4 and perhaps other Rab GTPases. In filamentous fungi the role of these proteins has not been investigated, and in the genome of Neurospora crassa only the gene gyp-3 (NCU04514) was found to correlate with MSB3 and MSB4 of S. cerevisiae. Therefore in this work the role of GYP-3 and its relationship with the polarisome in N. crassa was analyzed. The results show that GYP-3 is required for normal colony development and cell morphology since the Deltagyp-3 strain displayed a substantial reduction in colony diameter and hyphae showed a distorted morphology expressed as a general pattern of bulging areas in the distal region and hyphae were thinner at the active growing zone. The lack of GYP-3 had no effects on the localization of the polarisome components SPA-2 and BNI-1. Likewise, GYP-3 was not necessary for the normal localization of the F-actin population, however the dynamics of the Spitzenkorper (Spk) and the actin population at the apical region seemed to be destabilized. Additionally, the lack of GYP-3 strongly affects the localization and dynamics of SEC-4; which no longer accumulates at the tip of hyphae. The results presented here strongly suggest that GYP-3 is not part of the polarisome; however it requires the scaffold protein SPA-2 for arriving at the tip of hyphae. Although GYP-3 is not essential for cell survival, it has an important role in maintaining normal cell growth and morphology in N. crassa.","['GYP-3', 'MSB3', 'MSB4', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Polarisome', 'Rab GTPase-activating protein', 'SEC-4']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2019 Jul

Here, we report the role of the fungal-specific regulatory velvet complexes in development and secondary metabolism (SM) in N. crassa Three velvet proteins VE-1, VE-2, VOS-1, and a putative methyltransferase LAE-1 show light-independent nucleocytoplasmic localization. Two distinct velvet complexes, a heterotrimeric VE-1/VE-2/LAE-1 and a heterodimeric VE-2/VOS-1 are found in vivo The heterotrimer-complex, which positively regulates sexual development and represses asexual sporulation, suppresses siderophore coprogen production under iron starvation conditions. The VE-1/VE-2 heterodimer controls carotene production. VE-1 regulates the expression of >15% of the whole genome, comprising mainly regulatory and developmental features. We also studied intergenera functions of the velvet complex through complementation of Aspergillus nidulans veA, velB, laeA, vosA mutants with their N. crassa orthologs ve-1, ve-2, lae-1, and vos-1, respectively. Expression of VE-1 and VE-2 in A. nidulans successfully substitutes the developmental and SM functions of VeA and VelB by forming two functional chimeric velvet complexes in vivo, VelB/VE-1/LaeA and VE-2/VeA/LaeA, respectively. Reciprocally, expression of veA restores the phenotypes of the N. crassa ve-1 mutant.

27363849,Regulation of Neurospora crassa cell wall remodeling via the cot-1 pathway is mediated by gul-1.,"Impairment of the Neurospora crassa Nuclear DBF2-related kinase-encoding gene cot-1 results in pleiotropic effects, including abnormally thick hyphal cell walls and septa. An increase in the transcript abundance of genes encoding chitin and glucan synthases and the chitinase gh18-5, but not the cell wall integrity pathway transcription factor rlm-1, accompany the phenotypic changes observed. Deletion of chs-5 or chs-7 in a cot-1 background results in a reduction of hyperbranching frequency characteristic of the cot-1 parent. gul-1 (a homologue of the yeast SSD1 gene) encodes a translational regulator and has been shown to partially suppress cot-1. We demonstrate that the high expression levels of the cell wall remodeling genes analyzed is curbed, and reaches near wild type levels, when gul-1 is inactivated. This is accompanied by morphological changes that include reduced cell wall thickness and restoration of normal chitin levels. We conclude that gul-1 is a mediator of cell wall remodeling within the cot-1 pathway.","['Cell wall remodeling', 'Chitin synthase', 'Ssd1', 'cot-1', 'fks-1', 'gul-1']",Current genetics,Israel,2017 Feb
30615944,The actin motor MYO-5 effect in the intracellular organization of Neurospora crassa.,"In filamentous fungi, polarized growth is the result of vesicle secretion at the hyphal apex. Motor proteins mediate vesicle transport to target destinations on the plasma membrane via actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Myosins are motor proteins associated with actin filaments. Specifically, class V myosins are responsible for cargo transport in eukaryotes. We studied the dynamics and localization of myosin V in wild type hyphae of Neurospora crassa and in hyphae that lacked MYO-5. In wild type hyphae, MYO-5-GFP was localized concentrated in the hyphal apex and colocalized with Spitzenkorper. Photobleaching studies showed that MYO-5-GFP was transported to the apex from subapical hyphal regions. The deletion of the class V myosin resulted in a reduced rate of hyphal growth, apical hyperbranching, and intermittent loss of hyphal polarity. MYO-5 did not participate in breaking the symmetrical growth during germination but contributed in the apical organization upon establishment of polarized growth. In the Deltamyo-5 mutant, actin was organized into thick cables in the apical and subapical hyphal regions, and the number of endocytic patches was reduced. The microvesicles-chitosomes observed with CHS-1-GFP were distributed as a cloud occupying the apical dome and not in the Spitzenkorper as the WT strain. The mitochondrial movement was not associated with MYO-5, but tubular vacuole position is MYO-5-dependent. These results suggest that MYO-5 plays a role in maintaining apical organization and the integrity of the Spitzenkorper and is required for normal hyphal growth, polarity, septation, conidiation, and proper conidial germination.","['Actin', 'Class V myosin', 'MYO-5', 'Neursopora crassa', 'Vacuoles']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2019 Apr
25329823,Gene expression differences among three Neurospora species reveal genes required for sexual reproduction in Neurospora crassa.,"Many fungi form complex three-dimensional fruiting bodies, within which the meiotic machinery for sexual spore production has been considered to be largely conserved over evolutionary time. Indeed, much of what we know about meiosis in plant and animal taxa has been deeply informed by studies of meiosis in Saccharomyces and Neurospora. Nevertheless, the genetic basis of fruiting body development and its regulation in relation to meiosis in fungi is barely known, even within the best studied multicellular fungal model Neurospora crassa. We characterized morphological development and genome-wide transcriptomics in the closely related species Neurospora crassa, Neurospora tetrasperma, and Neurospora discreta, across eight stages of sexual development. Despite diverse life histories within the genus, all three species produce vase-shaped perithecia. Transcriptome sequencing provided gene expression levels of orthologous genes among all three species. Expression of key meiosis genes and sporulation genes corresponded to known phenotypic and developmental differences among these Neurospora species during sexual development. We assembled a list of genes putatively relevant to the recent evolution of fruiting body development by sorting genes whose relative expression across developmental stages increased more in N. crassa relative to the other species. Then, in N. crassa, we characterized the phenotypes of fruiting bodies arising from crosses of homozygous knockout strains of the top genes. Eight N. crassa genes were found to be critical for the successful formation of perithecia. The absence of these genes in these crosses resulted in either no perithecium formation or in arrested development at an early stage. Our results provide insight into the genetic basis of Neurospora sexual reproduction, which is also of great importance with regard to other multicellular ascomycetes, including perithecium-forming pathogens, such as Claviceps purpurea, Ophiostoma ulmi, and Glomerella graminicola.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2014
32777385,In vitro and in vivo characterization of genes involved in mannan degradation in Neurospora crassa.,"To better understand the roles of genes involved in mannan degradation in filamentous fungi, in this study we searched, identified, and characterized one putative GH5 endo-beta-mannanase (GH5-7) and two putative GH2 mannan-degrading enzymes (GH2-1 and GH2-4) in Neurospora crassa. Real-time RT-PCR analyses showed that the expression levels of these genes were significantly up-regulated when the cells were grown in mannan-containing media where the induction level of gh5-7 was the highest. All three proteins were heterologously expressed and purified. GH5-7 displayed a substrate preference toward galactomannan by showing 10-times higher catalytic efficiency than to linear beta-mannan. In contrast, GH2-1 preferred short manno-oligosaccharides or beta-mannan as substrates. Compared to the wild type strain, the growth of Deltagh5-7 and Deltagh5-7Deltagh2-4 mutants, but not Deltagh2-1, Deltagh2-4, and Deltagh2-1Deltagh2-4 mutants, was poor in the cultures containing glucomannan or galactomannan as the sole carbon source, suggesting that GH5-7 plays a critical role in the utilization of heteromannans in vivo. On the other hand, all the mutants showed significantly slow growth when grown in the medium containing linear beta-mannan. Collectively, these results indicate that N. crassa can utilize glucomannan and galactomannan without GH2-1 and GH2-4, but efficient degradation of beta-mannan requires a concerted action of three enzymes, GH5-7, GH2-1, and GH2-4.","['Galactomannan', 'Manno-oligosaccharide', 'Neurospora crassa', 'P-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannopyranoside', 'beta-mannan', 'beta-mannanases', 'beta-mannosidases']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Japan,2020 Nov
24879124,Heterochromatin controls gammaH2A localization in Neurospora crassa.,"In response to genotoxic stress, ATR and ATM kinases phosphorylate H2A in fungi and H2AX in animals on a C-terminal serine. The resulting modified histone, called gammaH2A, recruits chromatin-binding proteins that stabilize stalled replication forks or promote DNA double-strand-break repair. To identify genomic loci that might be prone to replication fork stalling or DNA breakage in Neurospora crassa, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of gammaH2A followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). gammaH2A-containing nucleosomes are enriched in Neurospora heterochromatin domains. These domains are comprised of A.T-rich repetitive DNA sequences associated with histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 (H3K9me), the H3K9me-binding protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), and DNA cytosine methylation. H3K9 methylation, catalyzed by DIM-5, is required for normal gammaH2A localization. In contrast, gammaH2A is not required for H3K9 methylation or DNA methylation. Normal gammaH2A localization also depends on HP1 and a histone deacetylase, HDA-1, but is independent of the DNA methyltransferase DIM-2. gammaH2A is globally induced in dim-5 mutants under normal growth conditions, suggesting that the DNA damage response is activated in these mutants in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Together, these data suggest that heterochromatin formation is essential for normal DNA replication or repair.",?,Eukaryotic cell,USA,2014 Aug
26025978,Identification of Allorecognition Loci in Neurospora crassa by Genomics and Evolutionary Approaches.,"Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of the ability to distinguish self from nonself (allorecognition) and mechanisms underlying evolution of allorecognition systems is an important endeavor for understanding cases where it becomes dysfunctional, such as in autoimmune disorders. In filamentous fungi, allorecognition can result in vegetative or heterokaryon incompatibility, which is a type of programmed cell death that occurs following fusion of genetically different cells. Allorecognition is genetically controlled by het loci, with coexpression of any combination of incompatible alleles triggering vegetative incompatibility. Herein, we identified, characterized, and inferred the evolutionary history of candidate het loci in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. As characterized het loci encode proteins carrying an HET domain, we annotated HET domain genes in 25 isolates from a natural population along with the N. crassa reference genome using resequencing data. Because allorecognition systems can be affected by frequency-dependent selection favoring rare alleles (i.e., balancing selection), we mined resequencing data for HET domain loci whose alleles displayed elevated levels of variability, excess of intermediate frequency alleles, and deep gene genealogies. From these analyses, 34 HET domain loci were identified as likely to be under balancing selection. Using transformation, incompatibility assays and genetic analyses, we determined that one of these candidates functioned as a het locus (het-e). The het-e locus has three divergent allelic groups that showed signatures of positive selection, intra- and intergroup recombination, and trans-species polymorphism. Our findings represent a compelling case of balancing selection functioning on multiple alleles across multiple loci potentially involved in allorecognition.","['Neurospora crassa', 'allorecognition', 'balancing selection', 'heterokaryon incompatibility', 'programmed cell death', 'self/nonself recognition', 'trans-species polymorphism', 'vegetative incompatibility']",Molecular biology and evolution,Berkeley,2015 Sep
28696922,Functional Profiling of Transcription Factor Genes in Neurospora crassa.,"Regulation of gene expression by DNA-binding transcription factors is essential for proper control of growth and development in all organisms. In this study, we annotate and characterize growth and developmental phenotypes for transcription factor genes in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa We identified 312 transcription factor genes, corresponding to 3.2% of the protein coding genes in the genome. The largest class was the fungal-specific Zn(2)Cys(6) (C6) binuclear cluster, with 135 members, followed by the highly conserved C2H2 zinc finger group, with 61 genes. Viable knockout mutants were produced for 273 genes, and complete growth and developmental phenotypic data are available for 242 strains, with 64% possessing at least one defect. The most prominent defect observed was in growth of basal hyphae (43% of mutants analyzed), followed by asexual sporulation (38%), and the various stages of sexual development (19%). Two growth or developmental defects were observed for 21% of the mutants, while 8% were defective in all three major phenotypes tested. Analysis of available mRNA expression data for a time course of sexual development revealed mutants with sexual phenotypes that correlate with transcription factor transcript abundance in wild type. Inspection of this data also implicated cryptic roles in sexual development for several cotranscribed transcription factor genes that do not produce a phenotype when mutated.","['filamentous fungi', 'functional genomics', 'gene knockouts', 'transcription factors', 'transcriptional profiling']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology,2017 Sep 7

Here, we demonstrate the catalytic voltammetry of variants of N. crassa NRs on a modified Au electrode with the electrochemically reduced forms of benzyl viologen (BV(2+)) and anthraquinone sulfonate (AQS(-)) acting as artificial electron donors. The biopolymer chitosan used to entrap NR on the electrode non-covalently and the enzyme film was both stable and highly active. Electrochemistry was conducted on two distinct forms; one lacking the FAD cofactor and the other lacking both the FAD and heme cofactors. While both enzymes showed catalytic nitrate reductase activity, removal of the heme cofactor resulted in a more significant effect on the rate of nitrate reduction.

35858815,Glucuronoyl esterase facilitates biomass degradation in Neurospora crassa by upregulating the expression of plant biomass-degrading enzymes.,"Glucuronoyl esterase (GE) is a promising agent for the delignification of plant biomass since it has been shown to cleave the linkage between xylan and lignin in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that NcGE, a GE from Neurospora crassa, stimulates plant biomass degradation. In vitro, NcGE synergistically increased the release of reducing sugars from plant biomass when added together with cellulase or xylanase. In vivo, overexpression of NcGE in N. crassa resulted in an increase in xylanolytic activity. Consistently, elevated transcription of genes encoding the major plant biomass degrading-enzymes (PBDEs) was observed in the NcGE overexpression strain. Increased xylanolytic activity and transcription of PDBE genes were largely abolished when the transcription factors clr-1, clr-2, or xlr-1 were deleted. Interestingly, the expression of some PBDE genes was increased when the hydrolysate of plant biomass by NcGE was added to the culture medium. We propose that NcGE boosts the production of PBDEs through the activation of key transcription factors, which is presumably caused by NcGE-mediated generation of hypothetical inducer(s) from plant biomass.","['Neurospora crassa', 'cellulase', 'glucuronoyl esterase', 'plant biomass', 'xylanase']",The Journal of general and applied microbiology,The University of Tokyo,2023 Mar 6
28847945,A-to-I RNA editing is developmentally regulated and generally adaptive for sexual reproduction in Neurospora crassa.,"Although fungi lack adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing was reported recently in Fusarium graminearum during sexual reproduction. In this study, we profiled the A-to-I editing landscape and characterized its functional and adaptive properties in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa A total of 40,677 A-to-I editing sites were identified, and approximately half of them displayed stage-specific editing or editing levels at different sexual stages. RNA-sequencing analysis with the Deltastc-1 and Deltasad-1 mutants confirmed A-to-I editing occurred before ascus development but became more prevalent during ascosporogenesis. Besides fungal-specific sequence and secondary structure preference, 63.5% of A-to-I editing sites were in the coding regions and 81.3% of them resulted in nonsynonymous recoding, resulting in a significant increase in the proteome complexity. Many genes involved in RNA silencing, DNA methylation, and histone modifications had extensive recoding, including sad-1, sms-3, qde-1, and dim-2. Fifty pseudogenes harbor premature stop codons that require A-to-I editing to encode full-length proteins. Unlike in humans, nonsynonymous editing events in N. crassa are generally beneficial and favored by positive selection. Almost half of the nonsynonymous editing sites in N. crassa are conserved and edited in Neurospora tetrasperma Furthermore, hundreds of them are conserved in F. graminearum and had higher editing levels. Two unknown genes with editing sites conserved between Neurospora and Fusarium were experimentally shown to be important for ascosporogenesis. This study comprehensively analyzed A-to-I editing in N. crassa and showed that RNA editing is stage-specific and generally adaptive, and may be functionally related to repeat induced point mutation and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA.","['Neurospora', 'RNA editing', 'RNA modification', 'adaptive evolution', 'perithecia']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,China 712100; jinrong@purdue.edu liuhuiquan@nwsuaf.edu.cn,2017 Sep 12
24474764,Circadian rhythms synchronize mitosis in Neurospora crassa.,"The cell cycle and the circadian clock communicate with each other, resulting in circadian-gated cell division cycles. Alterations in this network may lead to diseases such as cancer. Therefore, it is critical to identify molecular components that connect these two oscillators. However, molecular mechanisms between the clock and the cell cycle remain largely unknown. A model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, is a multinucleate system used to elucidate molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms, but not used to investigate the molecular coupling between these two oscillators. In this report, we show that a conserved coupling between the circadian clock and the cell cycle exists via serine/threonine protein kinase-29 (STK-29), the Neurospora homolog of mammalian WEE1 kinase. Based on this finding, we established a mathematical model that predicts circadian oscillations of cell cycle components and circadian clock-dependent synchronized nuclear divisions. We experimentally demonstrate that G1 and G2 cyclins, CLN-1 and CLB-1, respectively, oscillate in a circadian manner with bioluminescence reporters. The oscillations of clb-1 and stk-29 gene expression are abolished in a circadian arrhythmic frq(ko) mutant. Additionally, we show the light-induced phase shifts of a core circadian component, frq, as well as the gene expression of the cell cycle components clb-1 and stk-29, which may alter the timing of divisions. We then used a histone hH1-GFP reporter to observe nuclear divisions over time, and show that a large number of nuclear divisions occur in the evening.

The protein is detected only in aging and starving cultures and under other conditions, which induce autophagy, such as vegetative incompatibility or the presence of the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin.

27557053,Molecular Components of the Neurospora crassa pH Signaling Pathway and Their Regulation by pH and the PAC-3 Transcription Factor.,"Environmental pH induces a stress response triggering a signaling pathway whose components have been identified and characterized in several fungi. Neurospora crassa shares all six components of the Aspergillus nidulans pH signaling pathway, and we investigate here their regulation during an alkaline pH stress response. We show that the N. crassa pal mutant strains, with the exception of Deltapal-9, which is the A. nidulans palI homolog, exhibit low conidiation and are unable to grow at alkaline pH. Moreover, they accumulate the pigment melanin, most likely via regulation of the tyrosinase gene by the pH signaling components. The PAC-3 transcription factor binds to the tyrosinase promoter and negatively regulates its gene expression. PAC-3 also binds to all pal gene promoters, regulating their expression at normal growth pH and/or alkaline pH, which indicates a feedback regulation of PAC-3 in the pal gene expression. In addition, PAC-3 binds to the pac-3 promoter only at alkaline pH, most likely influencing the pac-3 expression at this pH suggesting that the activation of PAC-3 in N. crassa results from proteolytic processing and gene expression regulation by the pH signaling components. In N. crassa, PAC-3 is proteolytically processed in a single cleavage step predominately at alkaline pH; however, low levels of the processed protein can be observed at normal growth pH. We also demonstrate that PAC-3 preferentially localizes in the nucleus at alkaline pH stress and that the translocation may require the N. crassa importin-alpha since the PAC-3 nuclear localization signal (NLS) has a strong in vitro affinity with importin-alpha. The data presented here show that the pH signaling pathway in N. crassa shares all the components with the A. nidulans and S. cerevisiae pathways; however, it exhibits some properties not previously described in either organism.",?,PloS one,Brazil,2016
30718271,Integration of Self and Non-self Recognition Modulates Asexual Cell-to-Cell Communication in Neurospora crassa.,"Cells rarely exist alone, which drives the evolution of diverse mechanisms for identifying and responding appropriately to the presence of other nearby cells. Filamentous fungi depend on somatic cell-to-cell communication and fusion for the development and maintenance of a multicellular, interconnected colony that is characteristic of this group of organisms. The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a model for investigating the mechanisms of somatic cell-to-cell communication and fusion. N. crassa cells chemotropically grow toward genetically similar cells, which ultimately make physical contact and undergo cell fusion. Here, we describe the development of a Pprm1-luciferase reporter system that differentiates whether genes function upstream or downstream of a conserved MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling complex, by using a set of mutants required for communication and cell fusion. The vast majority of these mutants are deficient for self-fusion and for fusion when paired with wild-type cells. However, the Deltaham-11 mutant is unique in that it fails to undergo self-fusion, but chemotropic interactions and cell fusion are restored in Deltaham-11 + wild-type interactions. In genetically dissimilar cells, chemotropic interactions are regulated by genetic differences at doc-1 and doc-2, which regulate prefusion non-self recognition; cells with dissimilar doc-1 and doc-2 alleles show greatly reduced cell-fusion frequencies. Here, we show that HAM-11 functions in parallel with the DOC-1 and DOC-2 proteins to regulate the activity of the MAPK signaling complex. Together, our data support a model of integrated self and non-self recognition processes that modulate somatic cell-to-cell communication in N. crassa.","['MAP kinase', 'Neurospora crassa', 'cell fusion', 'cell-to-cell communication', 'chemotropic interactions', 'luciferase', 'non-self recognition']",Genetics,California 94720,2019 Apr
31413202,A pathway linking translation stress to checkpoint kinase 2 signaling in Neurospora crassa.,"Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK-2) is a key component of the DNA damage response (DDR). CHK-2 is activated by the PIP3-kinase-like kinases (PI3KKs) ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), and in metazoan also by DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). These DNA damage-dependent activation pathways are conserved and additional activation pathways of CHK-2 are not known. Here we show that PERIOD-4 (PRD-4), the CHK-2 ortholog of Neurospora crassa, is part of a signaling pathway that is activated when protein translation is compromised. Translation stress induces phosphorylation of PRD-4 by a PI3KK distinct from ATM and ATR. Our data indicate that the activating PI3KK is mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). We provide evidence that translation stress is sensed by unbalancing the expression levels of an unstable protein phosphatase that antagonizes phosphorylation of PRD-4 by mTOR complex 1 (TORC1). Hence, Neurospora mTOR and PRD-4 appear to coordinate metabolic state and cell cycle progression.","['Neurospora crassa', 'checkpoint kinase 2', 'circadian clock', 'mTOR', 'translation inhibition']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Germany axel.diernfellner@bzh.uni-heidelberg.de michael.brunner@bzh.uni-heidelberg.de,2019 Aug 27
32017762,Quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying phenotypic variation in bioethanol-related processes in Neurospora crassa.,"Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has received increasing attention over the past decade. Many attempts have been made to reduce the cost of bioethanol production by combining the separate steps of the process into a single-step process known as consolidated bioprocessing. This requires identification of organisms that can efficiently decompose lignocellulose to simple sugars and ferment the pentose and hexose sugars liberated to ethanol. There have been many attempts in engineering laboratory strains by adding new genes or modifying genes to expand the capacity of an industrial microorganism. There has been less attention in improving bioethanol-related processes utilizing natural variation existing in the natural ecotypes. In this study, we sought to identify genomic loci contributing to variation in saccharification of cellulose and fermentation of glucose in the fermenting cellulolytic fungus Neurospora crassa through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. We identified one major QTL contributing to fermentation of glucose and multiple putative QTL's underlying saccharification.

26453652,Characterization of a Novel Prevacuolar Compartment in Neurospora crassa.,"Using confocal microscopy, we observed ring-like organelles, similar in size to nuclei, in the hyphal tip of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. These organelles contained a subset of vacuolar proteins. We hypothesize that they are novel prevacuolar compartments (PVCs). We examined the locations of several vacuolar enzymes and of fluorescent compounds that target the vacuole. Vacuolar membrane proteins, such as the vacuolar ATPase (VMA-1) and the polyphosphate polymerase (VTC-4), were observed in the PVCs. A pigment produced by adenine auxotrophs, used to visualize vacuoles, also accumulated in PVCs. Soluble enzymes of the vacuolar lumen, alkaline phosphatase and carboxypeptidase Y, were not observed in PVCs. The fluorescent molecule Oregon Green 488 carboxylic acid diacetate, succinimidyl ester (carboxy-DFFDA) accumulated in vacuoles and in a subset of PVCs, suggesting maturation of PVCs from the tip to distal regions. Three of the nine Rab GTPases in N. crassa, RAB-2, RAB-4, and RAB-7, localized to the PVCs. RAB-2 and RAB-4, which have similar amino acid sequences, are present in filamentous fungi but not in yeasts, and no function has previously been reported for these Rab GTPases in fungi. PVCs are highly pleomorphic, producing tubular projections that subsequently become detached. Dynein and dynactin formed globular clusters enclosed inside the lumen of PVCs.

The most distinct structural features are their ability to interact with each other forming the RVB1/2 complex and their participation in several macromolecular protein complexes leading them to be involved in many biological processes. We report here the biochemical and biophysical characterization of the Neurospora crassa RVB-1/RVB-2 complex. Chromatographic analyses revealed that the complex (APO) predominantly exists as a dimer in solution although hexamers were also observed. Nucleotides influence the oligomerization state, while ATP favors hexamers formation, ADP favors the formation of multimeric states, likely dodecamers, and the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the contribution of certain amino acid residues in the nucleotide stabilization. The complex binds to dsDNA fragments and exhibits ATPase activity, which is strongly enhanced in the presence of DNA. In addition, both GFP-fused proteins are predominantly nuclear, and their nuclear localization signals (NLS) interact with importin-alpha (NcIMPalpha). Our findings show that some properties are specific of the fungus proteins despite of their high identity to orthologous proteins.

Elucidation of biogenesis mechanisms and functional characterization of sRNAs is often achieved using tools such as separation of small-sized RNA and deep sequencing. Although RNA interference pathways, such as quelling and meiotic silencing, have been well-described in Neurospora crassa, knowledge of sRNAs in other filamentous fungi is still limited compared to other eukaryotes. As a prerequisite for study, isolation and sequence analysis of sRNAs is necessary. We developed a protocol for isolation and library construction of sRNAs of 20-30 nt for deep sequencing in two filamentous fungi, N. crassa and Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici. Using 200-300 mug total RNA, sRNA was isolated by size-fractionation and ligated with adapters and amplified by RT-PCR for deep sequencing. Sequence analysis of several cDNA clones showed that the cloned sRNAs were not tRNAs and rRNAs and were fungal genome-specific.

In chronological order, we recognized three septum development stages: 1) septal actomyosin tangle (SAT) assembly, 2) contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) formation, 3) CAR constriction together with plasma membrane ingrowth and cell wall construction. Septation began with the assembly of a conspicuous tangle of cortical actin cables (SAT) in the septation site >5 min before plasma membrane ingrowth. Tropomyosin and myosin were detected as components of the SAT from the outset. The SAT gradually condensed to form a proto-CAR that preceded CAR formation. During septum development, the contractile actomyosin ring remained associated with the advancing edge of the septum. Formin and BUD-4 were recruited during the transition from SAT to CAR and CHS-1 appeared two min before CAR constriction. Actin patches containing fimbrin were observed surrounding the ingrowing septum, an indication of endocytic activity. Although the trigger of SAT assembly remains unclear, the regularity of septation both in space and time gives us reason to believe that the initiation of the septation process is integrated with the mechanisms that control both the cell cycle and the overall growth of hyphae, despite the asynchronous nature of mitosis in N. crassa.",?,PloS one,B.

26962146,Defining individual size in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.,"It is challenging to apply the tenets of individuality to filamentous fungi: a fungal mycelium can contain millions of genetically diverse but totipotent nuclei, each capable of founding new mycelia. Moreover, a single mycelium can potentially stretch over kilometres, and it is unlikely that its distant parts share resources or have the same fitness. Here, we directly measure how a single mycelium of the model ascomycete Neurospora crassa is patterned into reproductive units (RUs), meaning subpopulations of nuclei that propagate together as spores, and function as reproductive individuals. The density of RUs is sensitive to the geometry of growth; we detected 50-fold smaller RUs when mycelia had expanding frontiers than when they were constrained to grow in one direction only. RUs fragmented further when the mycelial network was perturbed. In mycelia with expanding frontiers, RU composition was strongly influenced by the distribution of genotypes early in development. Our results provide a concept of fungal individuality that is directly connected to reproductive potential, and therefore to theories of how fungal individuals adapt and evolve over time. Our data show that the size of reproductive individuals is a dynamic and environment-dependent property, even within apparently totally connected fungal mycelia.","['chimaerism', 'fungal biology', 'individuality', 'unit of selection']",Proceedings.

26577093,"Identification of TTAGGG-binding proteins in Neurospora crassa, a fungus with vertebrate-like telomere repeats.","BACKGROUND: To date, telomere research in fungi has mainly focused on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, despite the fact that both yeasts have degenerated telomeric repeats in contrast to the canonical TTAGGG motif found in vertebrates and also several other fungi. RESULTS: Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we here investigate the telosome of Neurospora crassa, a fungus with canonical telomeric repeats. We show that at least six of the candidates detected in our screen are direct TTAGGG-repeat binding proteins. While three of the direct interactors (NCU03416 [ncTbf1], NCU01991 [ncTbf2] and NCU02182 [ncTay1]) feature the known myb/homeobox DNA interaction domain also found in the vertebrate telomeric factors, we additionally show that a zinc-finger protein (NCU07846) and two proteins without any annotated DNA-binding domain (NCU02644 and NCU05718) are also direct double-strand TTAGGG binders. We further find two single-strand binders (NCU02404 [ncGbp2] and NCU07735 [ncTcg1]). CONCLUSION: By quantitative label-free interactomics we identify TTAGGG-binding proteins in Neurospora crassa, suggesting candidates for telomeric factors that are supported by phylogenomic comparison with yeast species. Intriguingly, homologs in yeast species with degenerated telomeric repeats are also TTAGGG-binding proteins, e.g. in S. cerevisiae Tbf1 recognizes the TTAGGG motif found in its subtelomeres. However, there is also a subset of proteins that is not conserved. While a rudimentary core TTAGGG-recognition machinery may be conserved across yeast species, our data suggests Neurospora as an emerging model organism with unique features.",?,BMC genomics,Germany,2015 Nov 17
29420579,Characterization of indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway-mediated biosynthesis of auxin in Neurospora crassa.,"Plants, bacteria and some fungi are known to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) by employing various pathways. Among these pathways, the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway is the best studied in green plants and plant-associated beneficial microbes. While IAA production circuitry in plants has been studied for decades, little is known regarding the IAA biosynthesis pathway in fungal species. Here, we present the first data for IAA-producing genes and the associated biosynthesis pathway in a non-pathogenic fungus, Neurospora crassa. For this purpose, we used a computational approach to determine the genes and outlined the IAA production circuitry in N. crassa. We then validated these data with experimental evidence. Here, we describe the homologous genes that are present in the IPA pathway of IAA production in N. crassa. High-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography unambiguously identified IAA, indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) and tryptophol (TOL) from cultures supplemented with tryptophan. Deletion of the gene (cfp) that encodes the enzyme indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase, which converts IPA to indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld), results in an accumulation of higher levels of ILA in the N. crassa culture medium. A double knock-out strain (Deltacbs-3;Deltaahd-2) for the enzyme IAAld dehydrogenase, which converts IAAld to IAA, shows a many fold decrease in IAA production compared with the wild type strain. The Deltacbs-3;Deltaahd-2 strain also displays slower conidiation and produces many fewer conidiospores than the wild type strain.",?,PloS one,Germany,2018
27786253,Synchronizing stochastic circadian oscillators in single cells of Neurospora crassa.,"The synchronization of stochastic coupled oscillators is a central problem in physics and an emerging problem in biology, particularly in the context of circadian rhythms. Most measurements on the biological clock are made at the macroscopic level of millions of cells. Here measurements are made on the oscillators in single cells of the model fungal system, Neurospora crassa, with droplet microfluidics and the use of a fluorescent recorder hooked up to a promoter on a clock controlled gene-2 (ccg-2). The oscillators of individual cells are stochastic with a period near 21 hours (h), and using a stochastic clock network ensemble fitted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo implemented on general-purpose graphical processing units (or GPGPUs) we estimated that >94% of the variation in ccg-2 expression was stochastic (as opposed to experimental error). To overcome this stochasticity at the macroscopic level, cells must synchronize their oscillators. Using a classic measure of similarity in cell trajectories within droplets, the intraclass correlation (ICC), the synchronization surface ICC is measured on >25,000 cells as a function of the number of neighboring cells within a droplet and of time. The synchronization surface provides evidence that cells communicate, and synchronization varies with genotype.",?,Scientific reports,USA,2016 Oct 27
31027568,A novel fungicide aminopyrifen inhibits GWT-1 protein in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis in Neurospora crassa.,"Aminopyrifen, 4-phenoxybenzyl 2-amino-6-methylnicotinate, strongly inhibited the mycelial growth of a wild-type Neurospora crassa strain on Vogel's minimal medium containing 1.2% sucrose, with a 0.001â€¯mg/L concentration required for 50% growth inhibition. Similar to micafungin, an inhibitor of beta-1, 3-glucan synthetase, aminopyrifen further inhibited the growth of N. crassa deletion mutants of MAP kinase cascade genes, such as mak-1 and mak-2, than the wild-type strain, suggesting that aminopyrifen perturbs cell wall-related processes. Furthermore, we found that three chitin synthase gene mutants (chs-1, chs-5, and chs-7) were highly sensitive to both chemicals; however, aminopyrifen, but not micafungin, induced a swollen germ tube from the conidia of chs-5 and chs-7 mutants on Vogel's medium containing 1.2% sucrose. To elucidate the target protein of aminopyrifen, we isolated mutants resistant to aminopyrifen after UV treatment of conidia of the wild-type strain or the chs-5 strain. The resistance mutations were localized to the gwt-1 gene that encodes an acyltransferase, GWT-1, which participates in the biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) precursor, and were found to result in S180F and V178A alterations in the protein. These results strongly suggest that aminopyrifen works as an inhibitor targeting GWT-1, a protein involved in GPI-anchor biosynthesis.","['Aminopyrifen', 'Cell wall', 'Chitin synthase', 'GPI-anchor biosynthesis', 'MAP kinase', 'gwt-1']",Pesticide biochemistry and physiology,Japan,2019 May
27060250,Direct electrochemistry of nitrate reductase from the fungus Neurospora crassa.,"We report the first direct (unmediated) catalytic electrochemistry of a eukaryotic nitrate reductase (NR). NR from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, is a member of the mononuclear molybdenum enzyme family and contains a Mo, heme and FAD cofactor which are involved in electron transfer from NAD(P)H to the (Mo) active site where reduction of nitrate to nitrite takes place. NR was adsorbed on an edge plane pyrolytic graphite (EPG) working electrode. Non-turnover redox responses were observed in the absence of nitrate from holo NR and three variants lacking the FAD, heme or Mo cofactor. The FAD response is due to dissociated cofactor in all cases. In the presence of nitrate, NR shows a pronounced cathodic catalytic wave with an apparent Michaelis constant (KM) of 39muM (pH7). The catalytic cathodic current increases with temperature from 5 to 35 degrees C and an activation enthalpy of 26kJmol(-1) was determined. In spite of dissociation of the FAD cofactor, catalytically activity is maintained.","['Enzyme', 'Molybdenum', 'Nitrate reductase', 'Voltammetry']",Biochimica et biophysica acta,Australia,2016 Sep

The cmd (RIP) mutant showed a defect in growth, reduced aerial hyphae, decreased carotenoid accumulation, a severe reduction in viability upon ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and a fertility defect. Moreover, meiotic silencing of the cmd gene resulted in a barren phenotype. In addition, we also performed site-directed mutational analysis of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase-2 (Ca(2+)/CaMK-2), a target of the CaM protein encoded by the cmd gene. The camk-2 (S247A) and the camk-2 (T267A) mutants in a homozygous cross, or in a cross with a Deltacamk-2 mutant, displayed an intermediate phenotype, suggesting that serine 247 and threonine 267 phosphorylation sites of the Ca(2+)/CaMK-2 are essential for full fertility in N. crassa. Therefore, CaM in N. crassa is required for normal vegetative growth, UV survival, and sexual development. Additionally, serine 247 and threonine 267 phosphorylation sites are important for the Ca(2+)/CaMK-2 function.","['Calcium signaling', 'Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases', 'Calmodulin', 'Meiotic silencing', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Repeat-induced point mutation']",Archives of microbiology,India,2017 May
24700367,Engineering the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa for lipid production from lignocellulosic biomass.,"Microbially produced triacylglycerol (TAG) is a potential feedstock for the production of biodiesel, but its commercialization will require high yields from low-cost renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulose. The present study employs a multi-gene approach to increasing TAG biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We demonstrate the redirection of carbon flux from glycogen biosynthesis towards fatty acid biosynthesis in a glycogen synthase deletion strain (Deltagsy-1). Furthermore, combining Deltagsy-1 with an enhanced TAG biosynthetic strain (acyl-Coenzyme A synthase; Deltaacs-3) of N. crassa yielded a twofold increase in total fatty acid accumulation over the control strain. The cellulose degrading potential of this double deletion strain was improved by deleting of the carbon catabolite regulation transcription factor (Deltacre-1) to create the triple deletion strain Deltaacs-3 Deltacre-1; Deltagsy-1. This strain exhibited early and increased cellulase expression, as well as fourfold increased total fatty acid accumulation over the control on inhibitor-free model cellulose medium. The Deltacre-1 mutation, however, was not beneficial for total fatty acid accumulation from pretreated lignocellulose. Conversion of dilute-acid pretreated Miscanthus to TAG was maximum in the constructed strain Deltaacs-3; Deltagsy-1, which accumulated 2.3-fold more total fatty acid than the wild-type control strain, corresponding to a total fatty acid yield of 37.9 mg/g dry untreated Miscanthus.","['Neurospora crassa', 'biodiesel', 'carbon catabolite repression', 'dilute-acid pretreated Miscanthus', 'microbial lipids']",Biotechnology and bioengineering,94720,2014 Jun
24037267,Early colony establishment in Neurospora crassa requires a MAP kinase regulatory network.,"Vegetative fusion is essential for the development of an interconnected colony in many filamentous fungi. In the ascomycete fungus Neurospora crassa, vegetative fusion occurs between germinated conidia (germlings) via specialized structures termed ""conidial anastomosis tubes"" (CATs) and between hyphae within a mature colony. In N. crassa, both CAT and hyphal fusion are under the regulation of a conserved MAP kinase cascade (NRC1, MEK2, and MAK2). Here we show that the predicted downstream target of the MAK2 kinase pathway, a Ste12-like transcription factor known as PP1, regulates elements required for CAT and hyphal fusion. The PP1 regulatory network was revealed by expression profiling of wild type and the Deltapp-1 mutant during conidial germination and colony establishment. To identify targets required for cell fusion more specifically, expression-profiling differences were assessed via inhibition of MAK2 kinase activity during chemotropic interactions and cell fusion. These approaches led to the identification of new targets of the cell fusion pathway that, when mutated, showed alterations in chemotropic signaling and cell fusion. In particular, conidial germlings carrying a deletion of NCU04732 (Deltaham-11) failed to show chemotropic interactions and cell fusion. However, signaling (as shown by oscillation of MAK2 and SO to CAT tips), chemotropism, and cell fusion were restored in Deltaham-11 germlings when matched with wild-type partner germlings. These data reveal novel insights into the complex process of self-signaling, germling fusion, and colony establishment in filamentous fungi.","['Neurospora crassa', 'STE12', 'cell fusion', 'chemotropism', 'signal transduction', 'transcriptional profiling']",Genetics,California 94720-3102,2013 Nov
32179551,Identification of a PRC2 Accessory Subunit Required for Subtelomeric H3K27 Methylation in Neurospora crassa.,"Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) in genomic regions of most eukaryotes and is critical for maintenance of the associated transcriptional repression. However, the mechanisms that shape the distribution of H3K27 methylation, such as recruitment of PRC2 to chromatin and/or stimulation of PRC2 activity, are unclear. Here, using a forward genetic approach in the model organism Neurospora crassa, we identified two alleles of a gene, NCU04278, encoding an unknown PRC2 accessory subunit (PAS). Loss of PAS resulted in losses of H3K27 methylation concentrated near the chromosome ends and derepression of a subset of associated subtelomeric genes. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry confirmed reciprocal interactions between PAS and known PRC2 subunits, and sequence similarity searches demonstrated that PAS is not unique to N. crassa PAS homologs likely influence the distribution of H3K27 methylation and underlying gene repression in a variety of fungal lineages.","['H3K27me3', 'Polycomb repressive complex 2', 'facultative heterochromatin', 'non-core PRC2', 'telomeric silencing']",Molecular and cellular biology,USA,2020 May 14

Biochemical assays of the fungal circadian clock typically involve growth in liquid medium where Neurospora forms a spherical ball of submerged mycelium. Here, we revive a method for dispersed growth of Neurospora in batch culture using polyacrylic acid as an additive to the medium. We demonstrate that dispersed growth cultures utilize more carbon than mycelial balls, but nonetheless retain a functional circadian clock.

Some of these effects are partially suppressed by inactivation of gul-1 (encoding an mRNA-binding protein involved in translational regulation). Here, we report on the transcriptional profiling of cot-1 inactivation and demonstrate that gul-1 affects transcript abundance of multiple genes in the COT-1 pathway, including processes such as cell wall remodeling, nitrogen and amino acid metabolism. The GUL-1 protein itself was found to be distributed within the entire hyphal cell, along with a clear presence of aggregates that traffic within the cytoplasm. Live imaging of GUL-1-GFP demonstrated that GUL-1 transport is microtubule-dependent. Cellular stress, as imposed by the presence of the cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor Nikkomycin Z or by nitrogen limitation, resulted in a 2-3-fold increase of GUL-1 aggregate association with nuclei.

31444295,Involvement of a G Protein Regulatory Circuit in Alternative Oxidase Production in Neurospora crassa.,"The Neurospora crassa nuclear aod-1 gene encodes an alternative oxidase that functions in mitochondria. The enzyme provides a branch from the standard electron transport chain by transferring electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen. In standard laboratory strains, aod-1 is transcribed at very low levels under normal growth conditions. However, if the standard electron transport chain is disrupted, aod-1 mRNA expression is induced and the AOD1 protein is produced. We previously identified a strain of N. crassa, that produces high levels of aod-1 transcript under non-inducing conditions. Here we have crossed this strain to a standard lab strain and determined the genomic sequences of the parents and several progeny. Analysis of the sequence data and the levels of aod-1 mRNA in uninduced cultures revealed that a frameshift mutation in the flbA gene results in the high uninduced expression of aod-1 The flbA gene encodes a regulator of G protein signaling that decreases the activity of the Galpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Our data suggest that strains with a functional flbA gene prevent uninduced expression of aod-1 by inactivating a G protein signaling pathway, and that this pathway is activated in cells grown under conditions that induce aod-1 Induced cells with a deletion of the gene encoding the Galpha protein still have a partial increase in aod-1 mRNA levels, suggesting a second pathway for inducing transcription of the gene in N. crassa We also present evidence that a translational control mechanism prevents production of AOD1 protein in uninduced cultures.","['AOX', 'G protein', 'Neurospora crassa', 'alternative oxidase', 'flbA']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Canada T6G 2E9 and,2019 Oct 7

How fungi sense cellulosic materials and respond by secreting enzymes has mainly been examined by assessing function of transcriptional regulators and via transcriptional profiling. Here, we obtained global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of the plant biomass degrading filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa grown on different carbon sources, i.e. sucrose, no carbon, and cellulose, by performing isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based LC-MS/MS analyses. A comparison between proteomes and transcriptomes under identical carbon conditions suggests that extensive post-transcriptional regulation occurs in N. crassa in response to exposure to cellulosic material. Several hundred amino acid residues with differential phosphorylation levels on crystalline cellulose (Avicel) or carbon-free medium vs sucrose medium were identified, including phosphorylation sites in a major transcriptional activator for cellulase genes, CLR1, as well as a cellobionic acid transporter, CBT1. Mutation of phosphorylation sites on CLR1 did not have a major effect on transactivation of cellulase production, while mutation of phosphorylation sites in CBT1 increased its transporting capacity.

24205386,Phospho-regulation of the Neurospora crassa septation initiation network.,"Proper cell division is essential for growth and development of uni- and multicellular organisms. The fungal septation initiation network (SIN) functions as kinase cascade that connects cell cycle progression with the initiation of cytokinesis. Miss-regulation of the homologous Hippo pathway in animals results in excessive cell proliferation and formation of tumors, underscoring the conservation of both pathways. How SIN proteins interact and transmit signals through the cascade is only beginning to be understood. Moreover, our understanding of septum formation and its regulation in filamentous fungi, which represent the vast majority of the fungal kingdom, is highly fragmentary. We determined that a tripartite kinase cascade, consisting of CDC-7, SID-1 and DBF-2, together with their regulatory subunits CDC-14 and MOB-1, is important for septum formation in the model mold Neurospora crassa. DBF-2 activity and septum formation requires auto-phosphorylation at Ser499 within the activation segment and phosphorylation of Thr671 in the hydrophobic motif by SID-1. Moreover, SID-1-stimulated DBF-2 activity is further enhanced by CDC-7, supporting a stepwise activation mechanism of the tripartite SIN kinase cascade in fungi. However, in contrast to the situation described for unicellular yeasts, the localization of the entire SIN cascade to spindle pole bodies is constitutive and cell cycle independent. Moreover, all SIN proteins except CDC-7 form cortical rings prior to septum initiation and localize to constricting septa. Thus, SIN localization and activity regulation significantly differs in unicellular versus syncytial ascomycete fungi.",?,PloS one,Germany,2013

The cnb-1(RIP) mutants showed sensitivity to calcium (Ca(2+)) and heat-shock stress conditions. Thus, calcineurin plays an essential role for vegetative and sexual developments, and tolerance to stress conditions in N. crassa.

23801409,Residual recombination in Neurospora crassa spo11 deletion homozygotes occurs during meiosis.,"Spo11 is considered responsible for initiation of meiotic recombination in higher organisms, but previous analysis using spo11 (RIP) mutants suggests that the his-3 region of Neurospora crassa experiences spo11-independent recombination. However, despite possessing several stop codons, it is conceivable that the mutants are not completely null. Also, since lack of spo11 interferes with chromosomal pairing and proper segregation at Meiosis I, spores can be partially diploid for a period after meiosis. Thus, it is possible that the recombination observed could be an abnormal event, occurring during the period of aneuploidy rather than during meiosis. To test the former hypothesis, we generated spo11 deletion homozygotes. Using crosses heteroallelic for his-3 mutations, we showed that His(+) progeny are generated in spo11 deletion homozygotes at a frequency at least as high as in wild type and, as in the spo11 (RIP) mutants, local crossing over is not reduced. To test the latter hypothesis, we utilised mutations in either end of a histone H1-GFP fusion gene, inserted between the recombination hotspot cog and his-3, in which GFP(+) spores arise as a result of recombination in a cross between the two GFP alleles. In a control cross homozygous for spo11 (+), the frequency at which GFP(+) spores arise is comparable to the frequency of His(+) spores and glowing nuclei first appear during prophase, prior to metaphase I, as expected for a product of meiotic recombination. Similarly in spo11 deletion homozygotes, GFP(+) spores arise at high frequency and glowing nuclei are first seen before metaphase, indicating that allelic recombination occurs during meiosis in the absence of spo11. We have therefore shown that spo11 is not essential for either his-3 allelic recombination or crossing over in the vicinity of his-3, and that spo11-independent allelic recombination is meiotic, indicating that there is a spo11-independent mechanism for initiation of recombination in Neurospora.",?,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,Australia,2013 Sep
28291519,Structural studies of Neurospora crassa LPMO9D and redox partner CDHIIA using neutron crystallography and small-angle scattering.,"Sensitivity to hydrogen/deuterium and lack of observable radiation damage makes cold neutrons an ideal probe the structural studies of proteins with highly photosensitive groups such as the copper center of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and heme redox cofactors of cellobiose dehydrogenases (CDHs). Here, neutron crystallography and small-angle neutron scattering are used to investigate Neurospora crassa LPMO9D (NcLPMO9D) and CDHIIA (NcCDHIIA), respectively. The presence of LPMO greatly enhances the efficiency of commercial glycoside hydrolase cocktails in the depolymerization of cellulose. LPMOs can receive electrons from CDHs to activate molecular dioxygen for the oxidation of cellulose resulting in chain cleavage and disruption of local crystallinity. Using neutron protein crystallography, the hydrogen/deuterium atoms of NcLPMO9D could be located throughout the structure. At the copper active site, the protonation states of the side chains of His1, His84, His157 and Tyr168, and the orientation of water molecules could be determined.

We analyzed the phenotypic and functional characteristics of DeltaNcZrg-17 and the implications of these characteristics in vivo.

Furthermore, the NcZrg-17 gene was found to be crucial for survival in the presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducing chemical agents. In addition, we found that DeltaNcZrg-17 mutant is defective in protein secretion on cellulose media under low zinc conditions, pointing towards a physiological role for NcZrg-17 in N. crassa. A gradual and delayed transcriptional upregulation (~ threefold) of NcZrg-17 on exposure to low zinc suggests its role in adaptation to low zinc rather than zinc homeostasis.

The genetic algorithms were at least an order of magnitude faster than ensemble methods using parallel tempering and appeared to provide a globally optimum solution from a random start in the initial guess of model parameters (i.e., rate constants and initial counts of molecules in a cell). The resulting goodness of fit [Formula: see text] was roughly halved versus solutions produced by ensemble methods using parallel tempering, and the resulting [Formula: see text] per data point was only [Formula: see text] = 2,708.05/953 = 2.84. The fitted model ensemble was robust to variation in proxies for ""cell size"". The fitted neutral models without cellular communication between single cells isolated by microfluidics provided evidence for only one Stochastic Resonance at one common level of stochastic intracellular noise across days from 6 to 36 h of light/dark (L/D) or in a D/D experiment. When the light-driven phase synchronization was strong as measured by the Kuramoto (K), there was degradation in the single cell oscillations away from the stochastic resonance. The rate constants for the stochastic clock network are consistent with those determined on a macroscopic scale of 10(7) cells.",?,Scientific reports,USA,2020 Sep 16
27856763,Normal chromosome conformation depends on subtelomeric facultative heterochromatin in Neurospora crassa.,"High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analyses revealed that the 3D structure of the Neurospora crassa genome is dominated by intra- and interchromosomal links between regions of heterochromatin, especially constitutive heterochromatin. Elimination of trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) or its binding partner Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1)-both prominent features of constitutive heterochromatin-have little effect on the Hi-C pattern. It remained possible that di- or trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3), which becomes localized in regions of constitutive heterochromatin when H3K9me3 or HP1 are lost, plays a critical role in the 3D structure of the genome. We found that H3K27me2/3, catalyzed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) member SET-7 (SET domain protein-7), does indeed play a prominent role in the Hi-C pattern of WT, but that its presence in regions normally occupied by H3K9me3 is not responsible for maintenance of the genome architecture when H3K9me3 is lost. The Hi-C pattern of a mutant defective in the PRC2 member N. crassa p55 (NPF), which is predominantly required for subtelomeric H3K27me2/3, was equivalent to that of the set-7 deletion strain, suggesting that subtelomeric facultative heterochromatin is paramount for normal chromosome conformation. Both PRC2 mutants showed decreased heterochromatin-heterochromatin contacts and increased euchromatin-heterochromatin contacts. Cytological observations suggested elimination of H3K27me2/3 leads to partial displacement of telomere clusters from the nuclear periphery. Transcriptional profiling of Deltadim-5, Deltaset-7, Deltaset-7; Deltadim-5, and Deltanpf strains detailed anticipated changes in gene expression but did not support the idea that global changes in genome architecture, per se, led to altered transcription.","['H3K27me2/3', 'Hi-C', 'Neurospora crassa', 'PRC2', 'facultative heterochromatin']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,OR 97403,2016 Dec 27
23733042,Transcriptional profiling of Neurospora crassa Deltamak-2 reveals that mitogen-activated protein kinase MAK-2 participates in the phosphate signaling pathway.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is an excellent model system for examining molecular responses to ambient signals in eukaryotic microorganisms. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is an essential growth-limiting nutrient in nature and is crucial for the synthesis of nucleic acids and the flow of genetic information. The genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling the response to Pi starvation in N. crassa include at least four genes (nuc-2, preg, pogv, and nuc-1), which are involved in a hierarchical regulatory activation network. In a previous work, we identified a number of genes modulated by NUC-2 protein, including the mak-2 gene, which codes for a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), suggesting its participation in the phosphate signaling pathway. Thus, to identify other genes involved in metabolic responses to exogenous phosphate sensing and the functioning of the MAPK MAK-2, we performed microarray experiments using a mak-2 knockout strain (Deltamak-2) grown under phosphate-shortage conditions by comparing its transcription profile to that of a control strain grown in low- and high-phosphate cultures. These experiments revealed 912 unique differentially expressed genes involved in a number of physiological processes related to phosphate transport, metabolism, and regulation as well as posttranslational modification of proteins, and MAPK signaling pathways. Quantitative Real-time PCR gene expression analysis of 18 selected genes, using independent RNA samples, validated our microarray results. A high Pearson correlation between microarray and quantitative Real-time PCR data was observed. The analysis of these differentially expressed genes in the Deltamak-2 strain provide evidence that the mak-2 gene participates in the hierarchical phosphate-signaling pathway in N. crassa in addition to its involvement in other metabolic routes such as the isoprenylation pathway, thus revealing novel aspects of the N. crassa phosphorus-sensing network.","['MAK-2', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Phosphate sensing']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Brazil,2013 Nov
30603874,Transcription factor CCG-8 plays a pivotal role in azole adaptive responses of Neurospora crassa by regulating intracellular azole accumulation.,"Azoles are the most widely used antifungals for controlling fungal infections in clinic and agriculture. Fungi can adapt to azole stress by rapidly activating the transcription of a number of genes, and some of these genes can elevate resistance to azoles. We had reported the transcription factor CCG-8 as a new regulator in the adaptation to antifungal azole stress in Neurospora crassa and Fusarium verticillioides. In this study, we further investigate the mechanisms by which CCG-8 promotes fungal adaptation to azole stress using N. crassa as a model. While deletion of ccg-8 made N. crassa hypersensitive to azoles, ccg-8 overexpression strain was more resistant to azoles than wild type, which further confirmed the positive role of ccg-8 in the adaptation to antifungal azoles. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that deletion of ccg-8 resulted in decrease of ergosterol biosynthesis, and high accumulation of toxic sterol 14alpha-methyl-3,6-diol and ketoconazole (KTC) in the cells, whereas intracellular accumulation of ketoconazole was decreased in the ccg-8 overexpression strain as compared to wild type. For analyzing the effect of CCG-8 on azole export, we tested the contribution of predicted multidrug transporters to azole resistance and found that CDR4 is the major contributor for azole efflux in N. crassa. Interestingly, overexpression of cdr4 or erg11 in the ccg-8 deletion mutant restored its hypersensitive phenotype and overexpression of cdr4 can reduce the level of intracellular KTC. However, the double mutant of ccg-8 and cdr4 was more sensitive than each single mutant, suggesting that drug efflux pump CDR4 plays less contribution for intracellular azole accumulation in the ccg-8 deletion mutant, and CCG-8 may regulate drug uptake. Together, our results revealed that CCG-8 plays a pivotal role in azole adaptive responses of N. crassa by regulating the drug accumulation in the cells.","['Adaptive responses', 'Antifungal resistance', 'Azoles', 'Neurospora crassa', 'ccg-8']",Current genetics,People's Republic of China,2019 Jun

26215788,Linear Discriminant Analysis Identifies Mitochondrially Localized Proteins in Neurospora crassa.,"Besides their role as powerhouses, mitochondria play a pivotal role in the spatial organization of numerous enzymatic functions. They are connected to the ER, and many pathways are organized through the mitochondrial membranes. Thus, the precise definition of mitochondrial proteomes remains a challenging task. Here, we have established a proteomic strategy to accurately determine the mitochondrial localization of proteins from the fungal model organism Neurospora crassa. This strategy relies on both highly pure mitochondria as well as the quantitative monitoring of mitochondrial components along their consecutive enrichment. Pure intact mitochondria were obtained by a multistep approach combining differential and density Percoll (ultra) centrifugations. When compared with three other intermediate enrichment stages, peptide sequencing and quantitative profiling of pure mitochondrial fractions revealed prototypic regulatory profiles of per se mitochondrial components. These regulatory profiles constitute a distinct cluster defining the mitochondrial compartment and support linear discriminant analyses, which rationalized the annotation process. In total, this approach experimentally validated the mitochondrial localization of 512 proteins including 57 proteins that had not been reported for N. crassa before.","['Mitochondrial proteomics', 'Neurospora crassa', 'd-arabinitol dehydrogenase', 'heme biosynthesis', 'linear discriminant analysis (LDA)']",Journal of proteome research,Germany,2015 Sep 4
23893079,The oxygenase CAO-1 of Neurospora crassa is a resveratrol cleavage enzyme.,"The genome of the ascomycete Neurospora crassa encodes CAO-1 and CAO-2, two members of the carotenoid cleavage oxygenase family that target double bonds in different substrates. Previous studies demonstrated the role of CAO-2 in cleaving the C40 carotene torulene, a key step in the synthesis of the C35 apocarotenoid pigment neurosporaxanthin. In this work, we investigated the activity of CAO-1, assuming that it may provide retinal, the chromophore of the NOP-1 rhodopsin, by cleaving beta-carotene. For this purpose, we tested CAO-1 activity with carotenoid substrates that were, however, not converted. In contrast and consistent with its sequence similarity to family members that act on stilbenes, CAO-1 cleaved the interphenyl Calpha-Cbeta double bond of resveratrol and its derivative piceatannol. CAO-1 did not convert five other similar stilbenes, indicating a requirement for a minimal number of unmodified hydroxyl groups in the stilbene background. Confirming its biological function in converting stilbenes, adding resveratrol led to a pronounced increase in cao-1 mRNA levels, while light, a key regulator of carotenoid metabolism, did not alter them. Targeted Deltacao-1 mutants were not impaired by the presence of resveratrol, a phytoalexin active against different fungi, which did not significantly affect the growth and development of wild-type Neurospora. However, under partial sorbose toxicity, the Deltacao-1 colonies exhibited faster radial growth than control strains in the presence of resveratrol, suggesting a moderate toxic effect of resveratrol cleavage products.",?,Eukaryotic cell,Spain,2013 Sep

Filamentous fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, have been proven to be highly amenable to the analysis of mitochondria, in part due to their rapid growth rate and relative ease of isolation. Here we describe a step-by-step procedure for the isolation of mitochondria from Fusarium species via differential centrifugation and density step-gradient centrifugation, and include methods to overcome potential complications. Mitochondria purified by flotation gradient procedures remain active for functional assays and can be further fractionated for isolation of nucleic acids or ribonucleoprotein particles that retain enzymatic activity.","['Cellular fractionation', 'Flotation gradient', 'Isolation and purification of mitochondria']","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",USA,2022

35735764,Neurospora casein kinase 1a recruits the circadian clock protein FRQ via the C-terminal lobe of its kinase domain.,"Timing by the circadian clock of Neurospora is associated with hyperphosphorylation of frequency (FRQ), which depends on anchoring casein kinase 1a (CK1a) to FRQ. It is not known how CK1a is anchored so that approximately 100 sites in FRQ can be targeted. Here, we identified two regions in CK1a, p1 and p2, that are required for anchoring to FRQ. Mutation of p1 or p2 impairs progressive hyperphosphorylation of FRQ. A p1-mutated strain is viable but its circadian clock is non-functional, whereas a p2-mutated strain is non-viable. Our data suggest that p1 and potentially also p2 in CK1a provide an interface for interaction with FRQ. Anchoring via p1-p2 leaves the active site of CK1a accessible for phosphorylation of FRQ at multiple sites.","['CK1', 'FRQ', 'Neurospora crassa', 'casein kinase 1', 'circadian clock']",FEBS letters,Germany,2022 Aug
28414919,Functional characterization of an N-terminally-truncated mitochondrial porin expressed in Neurospora crassa.,"Mitochondrial porin, which forms voltage-dependent anion-selective channels (VDAC) in the outer membrane, can be folded into a 19-beta-stranded barrel. The N terminus of the protein is external to the barrel and contains alpha-helical structure. Targeted modifications of the N-terminal region have been assessed in artificial membranes, leading to different models for gating in vitro. However, the in vivo requirements for gating and the N-terminal segment of porin are less well-understood. Using Neurospora crassa porin as a model, the effects of a partial deletion of the N-terminal segment were investigated. The protein, DeltaN2-12porin, is assembled into the outer membrane, albeit at lower levels than the wild-type protein. The resulting strain displays electron transport chain deficiencies, concomitant expression of alternative oxidase, and decreased growth rates. Nonetheless, its mitochondrial genome does not contain any significant mutations. Most of the genes that are expressed in high levels in porin-less N. crassa are expressed at levels similar to that of wild type or are slightly increased in DeltaN2-12porin strains. Thus, although the N-terminal segment of VDAC is required for complete function in vivo, low levels of a protein lacking part of the N terminus are able to rescue some of the defects associated with the absence of porin.","['N terminus', 'Neurospora crassa', 'VDAC', 'alternative oxidase', 'extremite N-terminale', 'mitochondrial porin', 'oxydase alternative', 'porine mitochondriale']",Canadian journal of microbiology,Canada,2017 Aug
26805950,"Localization and role of MYO-1, an endocytic protein in hyphae of Neurospora crassa.","The subapical endocytic collar is a prominent feature of hyphae of Neurospora crassa. It comprises a dynamic collection of actin patches associated with a number of proteins required for endocytosis, namely, ARP-2/3 complex, fimbrin, coronin, etc. We presently show that MYO-1 is another key component of this endocytic collar. A myo-1 sequence was identified in the genome of N. crassa and used it to generate a strain with a myo-1-sgfp allele under the ccg1 promoter. Examination of living hyphae by confocal microscopy, revealed MYO-1-GFP located mainly as a dynamic collection of small patches arranged in collar-like fashion in the hyphal subapex. Dual tagging showed MYO-1-GFP partially colocalized with two other endocytic proteins, fimbrin and coronin. MYO-1 was also present during septum formation. By recovering a viable strain, albeit severely inhibited, after deletion of myo-1, it was possible to investigate the phenotypic consequences of the elimination of MYO-1. Deletion of myo-1 caused a severe reduction in growth rate (95%), near absence of aerial mycelium and no conidiation. A reduced uptake of the lipophilic dye FM4-64 indicated a deficiency in endocytosis in the Deltamyo-1 mutant. Hyphae were produced by the Deltamyo-1 mutant but their morphogenesis was severely affected; hyphal morphology was distorted displaying irregular periods of isotropic and polarized growth. The morphological alterations were accompanied, and presumably caused, by a disruption in the organization and dynamics of a myosin-deprived actin cytoskeleton that, ultimately, compromised the stability and function of the Spitzenkorper as a vesicle supply center.","['Endocytosis', 'MYO-1', 'Morphogenesis', 'Myosin', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Polarized growth']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2016 Mar
27428111,qiRNApredictor: A Novel Computational Program for the Prediction of qiRNAs in Neurospora crassa.,"Recently, a new type of small interfering RNAs (qiRNAs) of typically 20~21 nucleotides was found in Neurospora crassa and rice and has been shown to regulate gene silencing in the DNA damage response. Identification of qiRNAs is fundamental for dissecting regulatory functions and molecular mechanisms. In contrast to other expensive and time-consuming experimental methods, the computational prediction of qiRNAs is a conveniently rapid method for gaining valuable information for a subsequent experimental verification. However, no tool existed to date for the prediction of qiRNAs. To this purpose, we developed the novel qiRNA prediction software package qiRNApredictor.

36435348,DNA interstrand crosslink repair by XPF-ERCC1 homologue confers ultraviolet resistance in Neurospora crassa.,"Ultraviolet (UV) light is a mutagen that causes DNA damage. Some UV-sensitive Neurospora crassa strains have been reported to exhibit a partial photoreactivation defect (PPD) phenotype, and the possible cause of this has been unknown for more than half a century. In this study, in the process of elucidating the possible causes of a PPD phenotype, we discovered that the XPF homologue MUS-38 is involved in repairing the UV-induced DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) in N. crassa. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the Deltamus-38 and Deltamus-44 strains to ICL agents was significantly higher than that of other nucleotide excision repair (NER)-related gene knockout (KO) strains, indicating that the MUS-38/MUS-44 complex is involved in an NER-independent ICL repair mechanism. Based on reports concerning the mammalian homologues XPF and ERCC1 we obtained separation-of-function mutants defective only in NER in mus-38 and mus-44. Additionally, the photoreactivation ability of these mutants was significantly higher than that of the KO strains. These results indicate that the PPD phenotype is caused by a defect in the repair-ability of ICL induced by UV and that an NER-independent ICL repair by MUS-38 and MUS-44 confers resistance to UV in N. crassa.","['DNA repair', 'Interstrand crosslink repair', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Nucleotide excision repair', 'Photoreactivation', 'XPF-ERCC1']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Japan,2023 Jan

36901932,Intracellular Nitric Oxide and cAMP Are Involved in Cellulolytic Enzyme Production in Neurospora crassa.,"Although molecular regulation of cellulolytic enzyme production in filamentous fungi has been actively explored, the underlying signaling processes in fungal cells are still not clearly understood. In this study, the molecular signaling mechanism regulating cellulase production in Neurospora crassa was investigated. We found that the transcription and extracellular cellulolytic activity of four cellulolytic enzymes (cbh1, gh6-2, gh5-1, and gh3-4) increased in Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose) medium. Intracellular nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detected by fluorescent dyes were observed in larger areas of fungal hyphae grown in Avicel medium compared to those grown in glucose medium. The transcription of the four cellulolytic enzyme genes in fungal hyphae grown in Avicel medium was significantly decreased and increased after NO was intracellularly removed and extracellularly added, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the cyclic AMP (cAMP) level in fungal cells was significantly decreased after intracellular NO removal, and the addition of cAMP could enhance cellulolytic enzyme activity. Taken together, our data suggest that the increase in intracellular NO in response to cellulose in media may have promoted the transcription of cellulolytic enzymes and participated in the elevation of intracellular cAMP, eventually leading to improved extracellular cellulolytic enzyme activity.","['MAPK', 'Neurospora crassa', 'cellulase', 'cyclic AMP', 'enzyme activity', 'enzyme production', 'filamentous fungi', 'nitric oxide', 'reactive oxygen species', 'signaling pathways']",International journal of molecular sciences,Republic of Korea,2023 Feb 24

In this study, optimization of fermentation conditions and co-cultivation of Neurospora crassa with Lactobacillus plantarum was performed in a simple bioreactor. The optimized fermentation of beer lees substrates through N. crassa led to the hydrolysis rates of crude fiber increasing to 43.27%.

When hens were fed 10% fermented oil-tea seedcake substrate, the ratio of feed to egg decreased from 3.1 to 2.6, egg production ratio increased from 65.71 to 80.10%, and color of vitelline (Roche) increased from 8.20 to 10.20. Fifteen kinds of carotenoids were identified by HPLC in fermented oil-tea seed cake substrates.

27062053,Beyond animals and plants: dynamic maternal effects in the fungus Neurospora crassa.,"Maternal effects are widely documented in animals and plants, but not in fungi or other eukaryotes. A principal cause of maternal effects is asymmetrical parental investment in a zygote, creating greater maternal vs. paternal influence on offspring phenotypes. Asymmetrical investments are not limited to animals and plants, but are also prevalent in fungi and groups including apicomplexans, dinoflagellates and red algae. Evidence suggesting maternal effects among fungi is sparse and anecdotal. In an experiment designed to test for maternal effects across sexual reproduction in the model fungus Neurospora crassa, we measured offspring phenotypes from crosses of all possible pairs of 22 individuals. Crosses encompassed reciprocals of 11 mating-type 'A' and 11 mating-type 'a' wild strains. After controlling for the genetic and geographic distances between strains in any individual cross, we found strong evidence for maternal control of perithecia (sporocarp) production, as well as maternal effects on spore numbers and spore germination. However, both parents exert equal influence on the percentage of spores that are pigmented and size of pigmented spores. We propose a model linking the stage-specific presence or absence of maternal effects to cellular developmental processes: effects appear to be mediated primarily through the maternal cytoplasm, and, after spore cell walls form, maternal influence on spore development is limited. Maternal effects in fungi, thus far largely ignored, are likely to shape species' evolution and ecologies. Moreover, the association of anisogamy and maternal effects in a fungus suggests maternal effects may also influence the biology of other anisogamous eukaryotes.","['Neurospora crassa', 'anisogamy', 'crossing distance', 'development', 'fungi', 'maternal effects', 'microbes', 'population genetics', 'quantitative genetics']",Journal of evolutionary biology,USA,2016 Jul

The disruption of any mutagen sensitive (mus) genes in the model fungus Neurospora crassa, i.e. mus-51, mus-52, or mus-53, orthologous to the human genes KU70, KU80, and LIG4, respectively, provides efficient tools for gene targeting. Accordingly, we used RNA-sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification techniques to evaluate the effects of mus-52 deletion in N. crassa gene transcriptional modulation, and thus, infer its influence regarding metabolic response to extracellular availability of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Notably, the absence of MUS-52 affected the transcription of a vast number of genes, highlighting the expression of those coding for transcription factors, kinases, circadian clocks, oxi-reduction balance, and membrane- and nucleolus-related proteins.

30413765,Asexual reproduction and growth rate: independent and plastic life history traits in Neurospora crassa.,"Trade-offs among traits influencing fitness are predicted by life history theory because resources allocated to one function are unavailable to another. Here we examine the relationship between two such traits, asexual reproduction and growth rate, in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, where shared genetic and physiological factors and a source-sink energetic relationship between growth and reproduction may constrain the evolution of these traits. To test growth-reproduction relationships in this species, we independently selected on mycelial growth rate or asexual spore production in a heterogeneous lab-derived population and evaluated the response of the non-selected traits. Combined with phenotypes for the 20 wild strains used to produce the heterogeneous population and the genome-wide genotypes of 468 strains, these data show that growth and reproduction are highly plastic in N. crassa and do not trade off either among wild strains or after laboratory selection in two environments. Rather, we find no predictable growth-reproduction relationship in the environments tested, indicating an effective absence of genetic constraint between these traits. Our results suggest that growth rate and asexual reproduction may not respond predictably to environmental change and suggest that reliance on a single trait as a proxy for fitness in fungal studies may be inadvisable.",?,The ISME journal,Sweden.

31392584,Increased reactive oxygen species production and maintenance of membrane potential in VDAC-less Neurospora crassa mitochondria.,"The highly abundant voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) allows transit of metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Previous studies in Neurospora crassa showed that the LoPo strain, expressing 50% of normal VDAC levels, is indistinguishable from wild-type (WT). In contrast, the absence of VDAC (DeltaPor-1), or the expression of an N-terminally truncated variant VDAC (DeltaN2-12porin), is associated with deficiencies in cytochromes b and aa(3) of complexes III and IV and concomitantly increased alternative oxidase (AOX) activity. These observations led us to investigate complex I and complex II activities in these strains, and to explore their mitochondrial bioenergetics. The current study reveals that the total NADH dehydrogenase activity is similar in mitochondria from WT, LoPo, DeltaPor-1 and DeltaN2-12porin strains; however, in DeltaPor-1 most of this activity is the product of rotenone-insensitive alternative NADH dehydrogenases. Unexpectedly, LoPo mitochondria have increased complex II activity. In all mitochondrial types analyzed, oxygen consumption is higher in the presence of the complex II substrate succinate, than with the NADH-linked (complex I) substrates glutamate and malate. When driven by a combination of complex I and II substrates, membrane potentials (Deltapsi) and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) under non-phosphorylating conditions are similar in all mitochondria. However, as expected, the induction of state 3 (phosphorylating) conditions in DeltaPor-1 mitochondria is associated with smaller but significant increases in OCR and smaller decreases in Deltapsi than those seen in wild-type mitochondria. High ROS production, particularly in the presence of rotenone, was observed under non-phosphorylating conditions in the DeltaPor-1 mitochondria. Thus, the absence of VDAC is associated with increased ROS production, in spite of AOX activity and wild-type OCR in DeltaPor-1 mitochondria.","['Alternative oxidase', 'Membrane potential', 'Mitochondrial porin', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'VDAC']",Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes,Canada,2019 Oct
31765390,STK-12 acts as a transcriptional brake to control the expression of cellulase-encoding genes in Neurospora crassa.,"Cellulolytic fungi have evolved a complex regulatory network to maintain the precise balance of nutrients required for growth and hydrolytic enzyme production. When fungi are exposed to cellulose, the transcript levels of cellulase genes rapidly increase and then decline. However, the mechanisms underlying this bell-shaped expression pattern are unclear. We systematically screened a protein kinase deletion set in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa to search for mutants exhibiting aberrant expression patterns of cellulase genes. We observed that the loss of stk-12 (NCU07378) caused a dramatic increase in cellulase production and an extended period of high transcript abundance of major cellulase genes. These results suggested that stk-12 plays a critical role as a brake to turn down the transcription of cellulase genes to repress the overexpression of hydrolytic enzymes and prevent energy wastage. Transcriptional profiling analyses revealed that cellulase gene expression levels were maintained at high levels for 56 h in the Deltastk-12 mutant, compared to only 8 h in the wild-type (WT) strain. After growth on cellulose for 3 days, the transcript levels of cellulase genes in the Deltastk-12 mutant were 3.3-fold over WT, and clr-2 (encoding a transcriptional activator) was up-regulated in Deltastk-12 while res-1 and rca-1 (encoding two cellulase repressors) were down-regulated. Consequently, total cellulase production in the Deltastk-12 mutant was 7-fold higher than in the WT. These results strongly suggest that stk-12 deletion results in dysregulation of the cellulase expression machinery. Further analyses showed that STK-12 directly targets IGO-1 to regulate cellulase production. The TORC1 pathway promoted cellulase production, at least partly, by inhibiting STK-12 function, and STK-12 and CRE-1 functioned in parallel pathways to repress cellulase gene expression. Our results clarify how cellulase genes are repressed at the transcriptional level during cellulose induction, and highlight a new strategy to improve industrial fungal strains.",?,PLoS genetics,China,2019 Nov
30687965,Principles of the animal molecular clock learned from Neurospora.,"Study of Neurospora, a model system evolutionarily related to animals and sharing a circadian system having nearly identical regulatory architecture to that of animals, has advanced our understanding of all circadian rhythms. Work on the molecular bases of the Oscillator began in Neurospora before any clock genes were cloned and provided the second example of a clock gene, frq, as well as the first direct experimental proof that the core of the Oscillator was built around a transcriptional translational negative feedback loop (TTFL). Proof that FRQ was a clock component provided the basis for understanding how light resets the clock, and this in turn provided the generally accepted understanding for how light resets all animal and fungal clocks. Experiments probing the mechanism of light resetting led to the first identification of a heterodimeric transcriptional activator as the positive element in a circadian feedback loop, and to the general description of the fungal/animal clock as a single step TTFL. The common means through which DNA damage impacts the Oscillator in fungi and animals was first described in Neurospora. Lastly, the systematic study of Output was pioneered in Neurospora, providing the vocabulary and conceptual framework for understanding how Output works in all cells. This model system has contributed to the current appreciation of the role of Intrinsic Disorder in clock proteins and to the documentation of the essential roles of protein post-translational modification, as distinct from turnover, in building a circadian clock.","['FRQ', 'White Collar Complex', 'input', 'oscillator', 'output']",The European journal of neuroscience,New Hampshire,2020 Jan

26639917,Around the Fungal Clock: Recent Advances in the Molecular Study of Circadian Clocks in Neurospora and Other Fungi.,"Night follows day and as a consequence, organisms have evolved molecular machineries that allow them to anticipate and respond to the many changes that accompany these transitions. Circadian clocks are precise yet plastic pacemakers that allow the temporal organization of a plethora of biological process. Circadian clocks are widespread across the tree of life and while their exact molecular components differ among phyla, they tend to share common design principles. In this review, we discuss the circadian system of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Historically, this fungus has served a key role in the genetic and molecular dissection of circadian clocks, aiding in their detailed mechanistic understanding. Recent studies have provided new insights into the daily molecular dynamics that constitute the Neurospora circadian oscillator, some of which have questioned traditional paradigms describing timekeeping mechanisms in eukaryotes. In addition, recent reports support the idea of a dynamic network of transcription factors underlying the rhythmicity of thousands of genes in Neurospora, many of which oscillate only under specific conditions. Besides Neurospora, which harbors the best characterized circadian system among filamentous fungi, the recent characterization of the circadian system of the plant-pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea has provided additional insights into the physiological impact of the clock and potential additional functions of clock proteins in fungi. Finally, we speculate on the presence of FRQ or FRQ-like proteins in diverse fungal lineages.","['Botrytis', 'Circadian rhythms', 'Fungi', 'Neurospora', 'Virulence']",Advances in genetics,Chile,2015
26812651,Meiotic Recombination in Neurospora crassa Proceeds by Two Pathways with Extensive Holliday Junction Migration.,"Analysis of thousands of Deltamsh-2 octads using our fluorescent recombination system indicates that, as in other filamentous fungi, symmetric heteroduplex is common in the his-3 region of Neurospora crassa. Symmetric heteroduplex arises from Holliday junction migration, and we suggest this mechanism explains the high frequency of His+ spores in heteroallelic crosses in which recombination is initiated cis to the his-3 allele further from the initiator, cog+. In contrast, when recombination is initiated cis to the his-3 allele closer to cog+, His+ spores are mainly a result of synthesis-dependent strand annealing, yielding asymmetric heteroduplex. Loss of Msh-2 function increases measures of allelic recombination in both his-3 and the fluorescent marker gene, indicating that mismatches in asymmetric heteroduplex, as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, tend to be repaired in the direction of restoration. Furthermore, the presence of substantial numbers of conversion octads in crosses lacking Msh-2 function suggests that the disjunction pathway described in S. cerevisiae is also active in Neurospora, adding to evidence for a universal model for meiotic recombination.",?,PloS one,Australia,2016
30914504,Metabolism and Development during Conidial Germination in Response to a Carbon-Nitrogen-Rich Synthetic or a Natural Source of Nutrition in Neurospora crassa.,"Fungal spores germinate and undergo vegetative growth, leading to either asexual or sexual reproductive dispersal. Previous research has indicated that among developmental regulatory genes, expression is conserved across nutritional environments, whereas pathways for carbon and nitrogen metabolism appear highly responsive-perhaps to accommodate differential nutritive processing. To comprehensively investigate conidial germination and the adaptive life history decision-making underlying these two modes of reproduction, we profiled transcription of Neurospora crassa germinating on two media: synthetic Bird medium, designed to promote asexual reproduction; and a natural maple sap medium, on which both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction manifest. A later start to germination but faster development was observed on synthetic medium. Metabolic genes exhibited altered expression in response to nutrients-at least 34% of the genes in the genome were significantly downregulated during the first two stages of conidial germination on synthetic medium. Knockouts of genes exhibiting differential expression across development altered germination and growth rates, as well as in one case causing abnormal germination. A consensus Bayesian network of these genes indicated especially tight integration of environmental sensing, asexual and sexual development, and nitrogen metabolism on a natural medium, suggesting that in natural environments, a more dynamic and tentative balance of asexual and sexual development may be typical of N. crassa colonies.IMPORTANCE One of the most remarkable successes of life is its ability to flourish in response to temporally and spatially varying environments. Fungi occupy diverse ecosystems, and their sensitivity to these environmental changes often drives major fungal life history decisions, including the major switch from vegetative growth to asexual or sexual reproduction. Spore germination comprises the first and simplest stage of vegetative growth. We examined the dependence of this early life history on the nutritional environment using genome-wide transcriptomics. We demonstrated that for developmental regulatory genes, expression was generally conserved across nutritional environments, whereas metabolic gene expression was highly labile. The level of activation of developmental genes did depend on current nutrient conditions, as did the modularity of metabolic and developmental response network interactions. This knowledge is critical to the development of future technologies that could manipulate fungal growth for medical, agricultural, or industrial purposes.","['artificial medium', 'asexual development', 'asexual-sexual switch', 'conidiospore', 'filamentous fungi', 'germination', 'natural medium']",mBio,USA,2019 Mar 26

Cell fusion between germinating spores is important for early colony establishment, while hyphal fusion in the mature colony facilitates the movement of resources and organelles throughout an established colony. Approximately 50 proteins have been shown to be important for somatic cell-cell communication and fusion in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Genetic, biochemical, and microscopic techniques were used to characterize the functions of seven previously poorly characterized cell fusion proteins. HAM-6, HAM-7 and HAM-8 share functional characteristics and are proposed to function in the same signaling network. Our data suggest that these proteins may form a sensor complex at the cell wall/plasma membrane for the MAK-1 cell wall integrity mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We also demonstrate that HAM-9, HAM-10, AMPH-1 and WHI-2 have more general functions and are required for normal growth and development. The activation status of the MAK-1 and MAK-2 MAPK pathways are altered in mutants lacking these proteins. We propose that these proteins may function to coordinate the activities of the two MAPK modules with other signaling pathways during cell fusion.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2014
25257783,Sensitivity of Neurospora crassa to a marine-derived Aspergillus tubingensis anhydride exhibiting antifungal activity that is mediated by the MAS1 protein.,"The fungus Aspergillus tubingensis (strain OY907) was isolated from the Mediterranean marine sponge Ircinia variabilis. Extracellular extracts produced by this strain were found to inhibit the growth of several fungi. Among the secreted extract components, a novel anhydride metabolite, tubingenoic anhydride A (1) as well as the known 2-carboxymethyl-3-hexylmaleic acid anhydride, asperic acid, and campyrone A and C were purified and their structure elucidated. Compound 1 and 2-carboxymethyl-3-hexylmaleic acid anhydride inhibited Neurospora crassa growth (MIC = 330 and 207 muM, respectively) and affected hyphal morphology. We produced a N. crassa mutant exhibiting tolerance to 1 and found that a yet-uncharacterized gene, designated mas-1, whose product is a cytosolic protein, confers sensitivity to this compound. The âˆ†mas-1 strain showed increased tolerance to sublethal concentrations of the chitin synthase inhibitor polyoxin D, when compared to the wild type. In addition, the expression of chitin synthase genes was highly elevated in the âˆ†mas-1 strain, suggesting the gene product is involved in cell wall biosynthesis and the novel anhydride interferes with its function.",?,Marine drugs,Israel. liat.koch@mail.huji.ac.il,2014 Sep 1

In this work, the crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of importin-alpha from N. crassa (IMPalpha-Nc) complexed with a classical NLS peptide (SV40 NLS) are reported. IMPalpha-Nc-SV40 NLS crystals diffracted X-rays to 2.0 A resolution and the structure was solved by molecular-replacement techniques, leading to a monomeric structure.

32471912,Quantitative Proteome Profiling Reveals Cellobiose-Dependent Protein Processing and Export Pathways for the Lignocellulolytic Response in Neurospora crassa.,"Filamentous fungi are intensively used for producing industrial enzymes, including lignocellulases. Employing insoluble cellulose to induce the production of lignocellulases causes some drawbacks, e.g., a complex fermentation operation, which can be overcome by using soluble inducers such as cellobiose. Here, a triple beta-glucosidase mutant of Neurospora crassa, which prevents rapid turnover of cellobiose and thus allows the disaccharide to induce lignocellulases, was applied to profile the proteome responses to cellobiose and cellulose (Avicel). Our results revealed a shared proteomic response to cellobiose and Avicel, whose elements included lignocellulases and cellulolytic product transporters. While the cellulolytic proteins showed a correlated increase in protein and mRNA levels, only a moderate correlation was observed on a proteomic scale between protein and mRNA levels (R(2) = 0.31). Ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing were significantly overrepresented in the protein set with increased protein but unchanged mRNA abundances in response to Avicel. Ribosome biogenesis, as well as protein processing and protein export, was also enriched in the protein set that showed increased abundance in response to cellobiose. NCU05895, a homolog of yeast CWH43, is potentially involved in transferring a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to nascent proteins. This protein showed increased abundance but no significant change in mRNA levels. Disruption of CWH43 resulted in a significant decrease in cellulase activities and secreted protein levels in cultures grown on Avicel, suggesting a positive regulatory role for CWH43 in cellulase production. The findings should have an impact on a systems engineering approach for strain improvement for the production of lignocellulases.IMPORTANCE Lignocellulases are important industrial enzymes for sustainable production of biofuels and bio-products. Insoluble cellulose has been commonly used to induce the production of lignocellulases in filamentous fungi, which causes a difficult fermentation operation and enzyme loss due to adsorption to cellulose. The disadvantages can be overcome by using soluble inducers, such as the disaccharide cellobiose. Quantitative proteome profiling of the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa revealed cellobiose-dependent pathways for cellulase production, including protein processing and export. A protein (CWH43) potentially involved in protein processing was found to be a positive regulator of lignocellulase production. The cellobiose-dependent mechanisms provide new opportunities to improve the production of lignocellulases in filamentous fungi.","['Neurospora', 'cellobiose', 'cellulase', 'cellulose', 'glycosylphosphatidylinositols', 'protein folding', 'protein translocation', 'protein transport', 'proteomics', 'ribosome synthesis']",Applied and environmental microbiology,People's Republic of China,2020 Jul 20
27694114,Epigenetic Control of Phenotypic Plasticity in the Filamentous Fungus Neurospora crassa.,"Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes under different environmental or developmental conditions. Phenotypic plasticity is a ubiquitous feature of living organisms, and is typically based on variable patterns of gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which gene expression is influenced and regulated during plastic responses are poorly understood in most organisms. While modifications to DNA and histone proteins have been implicated as likely candidates for generating and regulating phenotypic plasticity, specific details of each modification and its mode of operation have remained largely unknown. In this study, we investigated how epigenetic mechanisms affect phenotypic plasticity in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa By measuring reaction norms of strains that are deficient in one of several key physiological processes, we show that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in homeostasis and phenotypic plasticity of the fungus across a range of controlled environments. In general, effects on plasticity are specific to an environment and mechanism, indicating that epigenetic regulation is context dependent and is not governed by general plasticity genes. Specifically, we found that, in Neurospora, histone methylation at H3K36 affected plastic response to high temperatures, H3K4 methylation affected plastic response to pH, but H3K27 methylation had no effect. Similarly, DNA methylation had only a small effect in response to sucrose. Histone deacetylation mainly decreased reaction norm elevation, as did genes involved in histone demethylation and acetylation. In contrast, the RNA interference pathway was involved in plastic responses to multiple environments.","['DNA methylation', 'RNA interference', 'fungi', 'histone deacetylation', 'histone methylation', 'reaction norm']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Finland ilkka.kronholm@jyu.fi,2016 Dec 7
29351294,A HAD family phosphatase CSP-6 regulates the circadian output pathway in Neurospora crassa.,"Circadian clocks are ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms where they are used to anticipate regularly occurring diurnal and seasonal environmental changes. Nevertheless, little is known regarding pathways connecting the core clock to its output pathways. Here, we report that the HAD family phosphatase CSP-6 is required for overt circadian clock output but not for the core oscillation. The loss of function Deltacsp-6 deletion mutant is overtly arrhythmic on race tubes under free running conditions; however, reporter assays confirm that the FREQUENCY-WHITE COLLAR COMPLEX core circadian oscillator is functional, indicating a discrete block between oscillator and output. CSP-6 physically interacts with WHI-2, Deltawhi-2 mutant phenotypes resemble Deltacsp-6, and the CSP-6/WHI-2 complex physically interacts with WC-1, all suggesting that WC-1 is a direct target for CSP-6/WHI-2-mediated dephosphorylation and consistent with observed WC-1 hyperphosphorylation in Deltacsp-6. To identify the source of the block to output, known clock-controlled transcription factors were screened for rhythmicity in Deltacsp-6, identifying loss of circadian control of ADV-1, a direct target of WC-1, as responsible for the loss of overt rhythmicity. The CSP-6/WHI-2 complex thus participates in the clock output pathway by regulating WC-1 phosphorylation to promote proper transcriptional/translational activation of adv-1/ADV-1; these data establish an unexpected essential role for post-translational modification parallel to circadian transcriptional regulation in the early steps of circadian output.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2018 Jan
31270133,Plasma Membrane Integrity During Cell-Cell Fusion and in Response to Pore-Forming Drugs Is Promoted by the Penta-EF-Hand Protein PEF1 in Neurospora crassa.,"Plasma membrane damage commonly occurs during cellular growth and development. To counteract these potentially lethal injuries, membrane repair mechanisms have evolved, which promote the integrity of the lipid bilayer. Although the membrane of fungi is the target of important clinical drugs and agricultural fungicides, the molecular mechanisms which mediate membrane repair in these organisms remain elusive. Here we identify the penta-EF-hand protein PEF1 of the genetic model fungus Neurospora crassa as part of a cellular response mechanism against different types of membrane injury. Deletion of the pef1 gene in the wild type and different lysis-prone gene knockout mutants revealed a function of the protein in maintaining cell integrity during cell-cell fusion and in the presence of pore-forming drugs, such as the plant defense compound tomatine. By fluorescence and live-cell imaging we show that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PEF1 accumulates at the sites of membrane injury in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Ca(2+)-binding domains essential for the spatial dynamics and function of the protein. In addition, the subcellular localization of PEF1 revealed that the syncytial fungal colony undergoes compartmentation in response to antifungal treatment. We propose that plasma membrane repair in fungi constitutes an additional line of defense against membrane-disturbing drugs, thereby expanding the current model of fungal drug resistance mechanisms.","['Neurospora crassa', 'antifungal drug', 'cell fusion', 'membrane repair', 'penta-EF-hand protein']",Genetics,Germany,2019 Sep
25053707,Genome-wide characterization of light-regulated genes in Neurospora crassa.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa responds to light in complex ways. To thoroughly study the transcriptional response of this organism to light, RNA-seq was used to analyze capped and polyadenylated mRNA prepared from mycelium grown for 24 hr in the dark and then exposed to light for 0 (control) 15, 60, 120, and 240 min. More than three-quarters of all defined protein coding genes (79%) were expressed in these cells. The increased sensitivity of RNA-seq compared with previous microarray studies revealed that the RNA levels for 31% of expressed genes were affected two-fold or more by exposure to light. Additionally, a large class of mRNAs, enriched for transcripts specifying products involved in rRNA metabolism, showed decreased expression in response to light, indicating a heretofore undocumented effect of light on this pathway. Based on measured changes in mRNA levels, light generally increases cellular metabolism and at the same time causes significant oxidative stress to the organism. To deal with this stress, protective photopigments are made, antioxidants are produced, and genes involved in ribosome biogenesis are transiently repressed.","['Neurospora', 'RNA-seq', 'light']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Texas 77843-3258,2014 Jul 21

24190499,Analysis of cellodextrin transporters from Neurospora crassa in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for cellobiose fermentation.,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be engineered to ferment cellodextrins produced by cellulases as a product of cellulose hydrolysis. Direct fermentation of cellodextrins instead of glucose is advantageous because glucose inhibits cellulase activity and represses the fermentation of non-glucose sugars present in cellulosic hydrolyzates. To facilitate cellodextrin utilization by S. cerevisiae, a fungal cellodextrin-utilizing pathway from Neurospora crassa consisting of a cellodextrin transporter and a cellodextrin hydrolase has been introduced into S. cerevisiae. Two cellodextrin transporters (CDT-1 and CDT-2) were previously identified in N. crassa, but their kinetic properties and efficiency for cellobiose fermentation have not been studied in detail. In this study, CDT-1 and CDT-2, which are hypothesized to transport cellodextrin with distinct mechanisms, were introduced into S. cerevisiae along with an intracellular beta-glucosidase (GH1-1). Cellobiose transport assays with the resulting strains indicated that CDT-1 is a proton symporter while CDT-2 is a simple facilitator. A strain expressing CDT-1 and GH1-1 (DCDT-1G) showed faster cellobiose fermentation than the strain expressing CDT-2 and GH1-1 (DCDT-2G) under various culture conditions with different medium compositions and aeration levels. While CDT-2 is expected to have energetic benefits, the expression levels and kinetic properties of CDT-1 in S. cerevisiae appears to be optimum for cellobiose fermentation. These results suggest CDT-1 is a more effective cellobiose transporter than CDT-2 for engineering S. cerevisiae to ferment cellobiose.",?,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,USA,2014 Feb
28420736,Deciphering the Regulatory Network between the SREBP Pathway and Protein Secretion in Neurospora crassa.,"Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are conserved from yeast to mammalian cells and function in the regulation of sterol homeostasis. In fungi, the SREBP pathway has been implicated in the adaptation to hypoxia and in virulence. In Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma reesei, the SREBP pathway also negatively regulates protein secretion under lignocellulolytic conditions. Here we utilized global transcriptional profiling combined with genetic and physiological analyses to address the regulatory link between the SREBP pathway and protein secretion in N. crassa Our results demonstrated that the function of the SREBP pathway in ergosterol biosynthesis and adaptation to hypoxia was conserved in N. crassa Under lignocellulolytic conditions, the SREBP pathway was highly activated, resulting in the reduced expression of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, which require molecular oxygen for catalytic activity. Additionally, activation of the SREBP pathway under lignocellulolytic conditions repressed a set of genes predicted to be involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Here we show that the inability of a hac-1 mutant, which bears a deletion of the major regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), to efficiently produce cellulases and utilize cellulose was suppressed by mutations in the SREBP pathway. The analyses presented here demonstrated new SREBP pathway functions, including linkages to the UPR, and provide new clues for genetic engineering of filamentous fungi to improve their production of extracellular proteins.IMPORTANCE The role of SREBP transcription factors in the regulation of sterol biosynthesis is conserved from humans to yeast. In filamentous fungi, this pathway regulates the secretion of lignocellulolytic enzymes during plant biomass deconstruction. Here we show that the SREBP pathway in Neurospora crassa regulates the production of specific cellulases, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases that utilize molecular oxygen. Via global transcriptional profile and genetic analyses, a relationship between the SREBP pathway and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway was revealed, suggesting a regulatory interplay of these two pathways in the trafficking of plant biomass-degrading enzymes. These findings have implications for our understanding of the cross talk of the SREBP and UPR pathways in other organisms and will guide the rational engineering of fungal strains to improve cellulolytic enzyme production.",?,mBio,USA,2017 Apr 18

24607352,Regulation of vectorial supply of vesicles to the hyphal tip determines thigmotropism in Neurospora crassa.,"Thigmotropism is the ability of an organism to respond to a topographical stimulus by altering its axis of growth. The thigmotropic response of the model fungus Neurospora crassa was quantified using microfabricated glass slides with ridges of defined height. We show that the polarity machinery at the hyphal tip plays a role in the thigmotropic response of N. crassa. Deletion of N. crassa genes encoding the formin, BNI-1, and the Rho-GTPase, CDC-42, an activator of BNI-1 in yeast, CDC-24, its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and BEM-1, a scaffold protein in the same pathway, were all shown to significantly decrease the thigmotropic response. In contrast, deletion of genes encoding the cell end-marker protein, TEA-1, and KIP-1, the kinesin responsible for the localisation of TEA-1, significantly increased the thigmotropic response. These results suggest a mechanism of thigmotropism involving vesicle delivery to the hyphal tip via the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules. Neurospora crassa thigmotropic response differed subtly from that of Candida albicans where the stretch-activated calcium channel, Mid1, has been linked with thigmotropic behaviour. The MID-1 deficient mutant of N. crassa (Deltamid-1) and the effects of calcium depletion were examined here but no change in the thigmotropic response was observed. However, SPRAY, a putative calcium channel protein, was shown to be required for N. crassa thigmotropism. We propose that the thigmotropic response is a result of changes in the polarity machinery at the hyphal tip which are thought to be downstream effects of calcium signalling pathways triggered by mechanical stress at the tip.","['Calcium', 'Contact guidance', 'Fungal growth', 'Orientation', 'Polarity signal transduction']",Fungal biology,United Kingdom,2014 Mar
33038312,Kinetic solvent viscosity effects reveal a protein isomerization in the reductive half-reaction of Neurospora crassa class II nitronate monooxygenase.,"Nitronate monooxygenase from Neurospora crassa (NcNMO) is an FMN-dependent enzyme that oxidizes nitronates. The enzyme belongs to Group H of flavin monooxygenases. Previous biochemical and mechanistic studies on the enzyme showed that NcNMO oxidizes both anionic nitronates and neutral nitroalkanes, a feature distinguishing NcNMO from bacterial and other fungal NMOs which are active exclusively on nitronates. Recently, NMOs have been shown to oxidize propionate 3-nitronate (P3N), a toxic nitro acid present in legumes, fungi, and leaf beetles; P3N is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase causing anywhere from neurological disorders to death in livestock and humans. In this study, we report the first kinetic investigation of NcNMO with P3N and its conjugated acid 3-nitropropionic acid (3NPA), and a mechanistic investigation with 3NPA using kinetic solvent viscosity effects. The k(cat) value with P3N (300 s(-1)) was 7-times larger than with 3NPA and the k(cat)/K(P3N) value (1,700,000 M(-1)s(-1)) was ~500-times larger than the k(cat)/K(3NPA) value, consistent with P3N being a faster and better substrate than 3NPA. The normalized k(cat) and k(cat)/K(3NPA) values showed inverse hyperbolic dependences on the relative solvent viscosity, consistent with an internal isomerization of the enzyme-substrate complex. A similar inverse hyperbolic pattern of the normalized k(red) value for the rate constant of flavin reduction determined anaerobically in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer suggested that the internal enzyme isomerization occurs before the flavin reduction step in the reductive half-reaction.","['3-Nitroproprionate', 'Detoxification', 'Propionate-3-nitronate', 'Reductive half-reaction', 'Steady-state', 'Viscosity effect']",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,United States,2020 Nov 30

Anastomosis in filamentous fungi is comparable to other somatic cell fusion events resulting in syncytia, including myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation, macrophage fusion, and fusion of trophoblasts during placental development. In Neurospora crassa, fusion of genetically identical germlings is a highly dynamic and regulated process that requires components of a MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. The kinase pathway components (NRC-1, MEK-2 and MAK-2) and the scaffold protein HAM-5 are recruited to hyphae and germling tips undergoing chemotropic interactions. The MAK-2/HAM-5 protein complex shows dynamic oscillation to hyphae/germling tips during chemotropic interactions, and which is out-of-phase to the dynamic localization of SOFT, which is a scaffold protein for components of the cell wall integrity MAP kinase pathway. In this study, we functionally characterize HAM-5 by generating ham-5 truncation constructs and show that the N-terminal half of HAM-5 was essential for function. This region is required for MAK-2 and MEK-2 interaction and for correct cellular localization of HAM-5 to ""fusion puncta."" The localization of HAM-5 to puncta was not perturbed in 21 different fusion mutants, nor did these puncta colocalize with components of the secretory pathway. We also identified HAM-14 as a novel member of the HAM-5/MAK-2 pathway by mining MAK-2 phosphoproteomics data. HAM-14 was essential for germling fusion, but not for hyphal fusion. Colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation data indicate that HAM-14 interacts with MAK-2 and MEK-2 and may be involved in recruiting MAK-2 (and MEK-2) to complexes containing HAM-5.","['MAP kinase signaling', 'Neurospora crassa', 'cell fusion', 'chemotropism', 'protein complexes']",Genetics,California 94720,2016 May
27268441,Involvement of MAK-1 and MAK-2 MAP kinases in cell wall integrity in Neurospora crassa.,"Among three MAPK disruptants of Neurospora crassa, Deltamak-1 was sensitive and Deltamak-2 was hypersensitive to micafungin, a beta-1,3-glucan synthase inhibitor, than the wild-type or Deltaos-2 strains. We identified six micafungin-inducible genes that are involved in cell wall integrity (CWI) and found that MAK-1 regulated the transcription of non-anchored cell wall protein gene, ncw-1, and the beta-1,3-endoglucanase gene, bgt-2, whereas MAK-2 controlled the expression of the glycosylhydrolase-like protein gene, gh76-5, and the C4-dicarboxylate transporter gene, tdt-1. Western blotting analysis revealed that, in the wild-type strain, MAK-1 was constitutively phosphorylated from conidial germination to hyphal development. In contrast, the phosphorylation of MAK-2 was growth phase-dependent, and micafungin induced the phosphorylation of unphosphorylated MAK-2. It should be noted that the phosphorylation of MAK-1 was virtually abolished in the Deltamak-2 strain, but was significantly induced by micafungin, suggesting functional cross talk between MAK-1 and MAK-2 signalling pathway in CWI.","['MAP kinase', 'Neurospora crassa', 'cell wall integrity', 'micafungin']","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",Japan,2016 Sep
28602830,Phenotypic analysis of newly isolated short-lifespan Neurospora crassa mutant deficient in a high mobility group box protein.,"To elucidate genetic mechanisms affecting the lifespan of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, we attempted to identify a gene of which a defect causes a short-lifespan. By screening a Neurospora knockout library, provided by the Fungal Genetics Stock Center at Kansas State University, several KO strains with a short-lifespan were isolated. FGSC#11693 is one of these, which shows similar phenotypes to known Neurospora short-lifespan mutants as follows: 1) hyphal growth ceases after about 2weeks of cultivation, despite that of the wild-type continuing for over 2years, 2) viability of conidia is lower than that of the wild-type, and 3) high sensitivity to mutagens such as methyl methanesulfonate, ultraviolet radiation, and hydroxyl urea is exhibited. The NCU number of the knocked-out gene in the KO strain is NCU02695, and recovery from the short-lifespan and mutagen sensitivity was achieved by the introduction of this gene from the wild-type. The putative amino acid sequence of the knocked-out gene contains two high mobility group box domains and a mitochondrial localization signal is found at the N-terminal of this sequence. Upon analyzing the subcellular localization of the gene product fused with GFP, GFP signals were detected in mitochondria. From these observations, the gene and KO strain were named mitochondrial high mobility group box protein 1 (MHG1) and mhg1(KO) strain, respectively. The amount of mtDNA relative to the nuclear amount was lower in the mhg1(KO) strain than in the wild-type. mtDNA aberration was also observed in the mhg1(KO) strain. These results suggest that the MHG1 protein plays an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA, and mitochondrial abnormality caused by mtDNA aberration is responsible for the short-lifespan of the mhg1(KO) strain.","['High mobility group box protein', 'Mitochondrial DNA maintenance', 'Mutagen-sensitive', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Short-lifespan']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Japan.

31048503,Circadian clock regulation of the glycogen synthase (gsn) gene by WCC is critical for rhythmic glycogen metabolism in Neurospora crassa.,"Circadian clocks generate rhythms in cellular functions, including metabolism, to align biological processes with the 24-hour environment. Disruption of this alignment by shift work alters glucose homeostasis. Glucose homeostasis depends on signaling and allosteric control; however, the molecular mechanisms linking the clock to glucose homeostasis remain largely unknown. We investigated the molecular links between the clock and glycogen metabolism, a conserved glucose homeostatic process, in Neurospora crassa We find that glycogen synthase (gsn) mRNA, glycogen phosphorylase (gpn) mRNA, and glycogen levels, accumulate with a daily rhythm controlled by the circadian clock. Because the synthase and phosphorylase are critical to homeostasis, their roles in generating glycogen rhythms were investigated. We demonstrate that while gsn was necessary for glycogen production, constitutive gsn expression resulted in high and arrhythmic glycogen levels, and deletion of gpn abolished gsn mRNA rhythms and rhythmic glycogen accumulation. Furthermore, we show that gsn promoter activity is rhythmic and is directly controlled by core clock component white collar complex (WCC). We also discovered that WCC-regulated transcription factors, VOS-1 and CSP-1, modulate the phase and amplitude of rhythmic gsn mRNA, and these changes are similarly reflected in glycogen oscillations. Together, these data indicate the importance of clock-regulated gsn transcription over signaling or allosteric control of glycogen rhythms, a mechanism that is potentially conserved in mammals and critical to metabolic homeostasis.","['Neurospora crassa', 'circadian rhythms', 'glycogen metabolism', 'glycogen phosphorylase', 'glycogen synthase']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,OH 45267-0575,2019 May 21

However, monitoring N. crassa for an extended period of time with single nucleus resolution is a technically challenging task due to hyphal growth that rapidly moves beyond a region of interest during microscopy experiments.

24699390,Direct recognition of homology between double helices of DNA in Neurospora crassa.,"Chromosomal regions of identical or nearly identical DNA sequence can preferentially associate with one another in the apparent absence of DNA breakage. Molecular mechanism(s) underlying such homology-dependent pairing phenomena remain(s) unknown. Using Neurospora crassa repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) as a model system, we show that a pair of DNA segments can be recognized as homologous, if they share triplets of base pairs arrayed with the matching periodicity of 11 or 12 base pairs. This pattern suggests direct interactions between slightly underwound co-aligned DNA duplexes engaging once per turn and over many consecutive turns. The process occurs in the absence of MEI3, the only RAD51/DMC1 protein in N. crassa, demonstrating independence from the canonical homology recognition pathway. A new perspective is thus provided for further analysis of the breakage-independent recognition of homology that underlies RIP and, potentially, other processes where sequence-specific pairing of intact chromosomes is involved.",?,Nature communications,USA,2014 Apr 3
25398875,The putative cellodextrin transporter-like protein CLP1 is involved in cellulase induction in Neurospora crassa.,"Neurospora crassa recently has become a novel system to investigate cellulase induction. Here, we discovered a novel membrane protein, cellodextrin transporter-like protein 1 (CLP1; NCU05853), a putative cellodextrin transporter-like protein that is a critical component of the cellulase induction pathway in N. crassa. Although CLP1 protein cannot transport cellodextrin, the suppression of cellulase induction by this protein was discovered on both cellobiose and Avicel. The co-disruption of the cellodextrin transporters cdt2 and clp1 in strain Delta3betaG formed strain CPL7. With induction by cellobiose, cellulase production was enhanced 6.9-fold in CPL7 compared with Delta3betaG. We also showed that the suppression of cellulase expression by CLP1 occurred by repressing the expression of cellodextrin transporters, particularly cdt1 expression. Transcriptome analysis of the hypercellulase-producing strain CPL7 showed that the cellulase expression machinery was dramatically stimulated, as were the cellulase enzyme genes including the inducer transporters and the major transcriptional regulators.","['Bioenergy', 'Biofuel', 'CLP1', 'Cellodextrin Transporter', 'Cellulase', 'Fungi', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Transporter']",The Journal of biological chemistry,China,2015 Jan 9
29801794,Glucose sensing and light regulation: A mutation in the glucose sensor RCO-3 modifies photoadaptation in Neurospora crassa.,"Light regulates fungal gene transcription transiently leading to photoadaptation. In the ascomycete Neurospora crassa photoadaptation is mediated by interactions between a light-regulated transcription factor complex, the white collar complex, and the small photoreceptor VVD. Other proteins, like the RCO-1/RCM-1 repressor complex participate indirectly in photoadaptation. We show that RCO-3, a protein with high similarity to glucose transporters, is needed for photoadaptation. The mutation in rco-3 modifies the transcriptional response to light of several genes and leads to changes in photoadaptation without significantly changing the amount and regulation of WC-1. The mutation in rco-3, however, does not modify the capacity of the circadian clock to be reset by light. Our results add support to the proposal that there is a connection between glucose sensing and light regulation in Neurospora and that the fungus integrates different environmental signals to regulate transcription.","['Entrainment', 'Glucose sensing', 'Neurospora', 'Photoadaptation', 'Stress']",Fungal biology,Spain.

31581262,Genetic relationships between the RACK1 homolog cpc-2 and heterotrimeric G protein subunit genes in Neurospora crassa.,"Receptor for Activated C Kinase-1 (RACK1) is a multifunctional eukaryotic scaffolding protein with a seven WD repeat structure. Among their many cellular roles, RACK1 homologs have been shown to serve as alternative Gbeta subunits during heterotrimeric G protein signaling in many systems. We investigated genetic interactions between the RACK1 homolog cpc-2, the previously characterized Gbeta subunit gnb-1 and other G protein signaling components in the multicellular filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Results from cell fractionation studies and from fluorescent microscopy of a strain expressing a CPC-2-GFP fusion protein revealed that CPC-2 is a cytoplasmic protein. Genetic epistasis experiments between cpc-2, the three Galpha genes (gna-1, gna-2 and gna-3) and gnb-1 demonstrated that cpc-2 is epistatic to gna-2 with regards to basal hyphae growth rate and aerial hyphae height, while deletion of cpc-2 mitigates the increased macroconidiation on solid medium observed in Deltagnb-1 mutants. Deltacpc-2 mutants inappropriately produce conidiophores during growth in submerged culture and mutational activation of gna-3 alleviates this defect. Deltacpc-2 mutants are female-sterile and fertility could not be restored by mutational activation of any of the three Galpha genes. With the exception of macroconidiation on solid medium, double mutants lacking cpc-2 and gnb-1 exhibited more severe defects for all phenotypic traits, supporting a largely synergistic relationship between GNB-1 and CPC-2 in N. crassa.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2019
25851717,Reconstruction of the carnitine biosynthesis pathway from Neurospora crassa in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Industrial synthesis of L-carnitine is currently performed by whole-cell biotransformation of industrial waste products, mostly D-carnitine and cronobetaine, through specific bacterial species. No comparable system has been established using eukaryotic microorganisms, even though there is a significant and growing international demand for either the pure compound or carnitine-enriched consumables. In eukaryotes, including the fungus Neurospora crassa, L-carnitine is biosynthesized through a four-step metabolic conversion of trimethyllysine to L-carnitine. In contrast, the industrial yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks the enzymes of the eukaryotic biosynthesis pathway and is unable to synthesize carnitine. This study describes the cloning of all four of the N. crassa carnitine biosynthesis genes and the reconstruction of the entire pathway in S. cerevisiae. The engineered yeast strains were able to catalyze the synthesis of L-carnitine, which was quantified using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HILIC-ESI-MS) analyses, from trimethyllysine. Furthermore, the yeast threonine aldolase Gly1p was shown to effectively catalyze the second step of the pathway, fulfilling the role of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase. The analyses also identified yeast enzymes that interact with the introduced pathway, including Can1p, which was identified as the yeast transporter for trimethyllysine, and the two yeast serine hydroxymethyltransferases, Shm1p and Shm2p. Together, this study opens the possibility of using an engineered, carnitine-producing yeast in various industrial applications while providing insight into possible future strategies aimed at tailoring the production capacity of such strains.",?,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,South Africa,2015 Aug

Increasing concentration of Ca(2+) increased the expression of ncs-1; however, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 severely reduced ncs-1 mRNA transcript levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies revealed that the transcription factor calcineurin responsive zinc finger-1 (CRZ-1) binds to the ncs-1 promoter, and CRZ-1 binding upregulated ncs-1 expression under high Ca(2+) concentrations. These results suggested the regulation of NCS-1 function through calcineurin- CRZ-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the CRZ-1 binds specifically to an 8 bp sequence 5'-CCTTCACA-3' in the ncs-1 promoter 216 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. We also showed that NCS-1 binds to the Ca(2+) permeable channel MID-1 for tolerance to Ca(2+) stress. Therefore, CRZ-1 binds to a unique sequence in the ncs-1 promoter, causing upregulation of NCS-1 that binds to MID-1 for tolerance to Ca(2+) stress.",?,Molecular microbiology,India,2019 Jun
29718972,Structure of frequency-interacting RNA helicase from Neurospora crassa reveals high flexibility in a domain critical for circadian rhythm and RNA surveillance.,"The FRH (frequency-interacting RNA helicase) protein is the Neurospora crassa homolog of yeast Mtr4, an essential RNA helicase that plays a central role in RNA metabolism as an activator of the nuclear RNA exosome. FRH is also a required component of the circadian clock, mediating protein interactions that result in the rhythmic repression of gene expression. Here we show that FRH unwinds RNA substrates in vitro with a kinetic profile similar to Mtr4, indicating that while FRH has acquired additional functionality, its core helicase function remains intact. In contrast with the earlier FRH structures, a new crystal form of FRH results in an ATP binding site that is undisturbed by crystal contacts and adopts a conformation consistent with nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Strikingly, this new FRH structure adopts an arch domain conformation that is dramatically altered from previous structures. Comparison of the existing FRH structures reveals conserved hinge points that appear to facilitate arch motion. Regions in the arch have been previously shown to mediate a variety of protein-protein interactions critical for RNA surveillance and circadian clock functions. The conformational changes highlighted in the FRH structures provide a platform for investigating the relationship between arch dynamics and Mtr4/FRH function.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2018

In recent years, the molecular basis of this unusual cellular behavior has started to unfold, indicating the presence of an excitable signaling network. New evidence suggests that this communication system is highly conserved in ascomycete fungi and, unexpectedly, even mediates interspecies interactions. At the same time, intricate allorecognition mechanisms were identified, which prevent the fusion of genetically unlike individuals. These observations suggest that signal specificity during fungal social behavior has not evolved on the level of signals and receptors, but is achieved at downstream checkpoints.

23666236,Reduced glutathione export during programmed cell death of Neurospora crassa.,"In a previous study, we demonstrated that staurosporine (STS) induces programmed cell death (PCD) in the fungus Neurospora crassa and that glutathione has the capability of inhibiting both STS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and cell death. Here, we further investigated the role of glutathione in STS-induced PCD in N. crassa and observed an efflux of reduced glutathione (GSH) together with a change in the cell internal redox state to a more oxidative environment. This event was also observed with another PCD inducer, phytosphingosine (PHS), although externally added GSH did not prevent PHS-induced PCD. The nature of ROS, detected under the experimental conditions at which GSH export occurred, is also different in the two systems, predominantly superoxide in the case of STS and hydrogen peroxide in the case of PHS. In both cases, GSH export preceded the alterations in the plasma membrane that lead to selective dye permeation. We conclude that glutathione export in the context of PCD is not exclusive of certain mammalian cells and can be extended to Fungi, being an early PCD event in N. crassa. In addition, STS and PHS induce different PCD pathways in this fungus and the role of GSH export in each of them is likely different.",?,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,Portugal. afernand@ibmc.up.pt,2013 Aug
29678830,Regulation of Cell-to-Cell Communication and Cell Wall Integrity by a Network of MAP Kinase Pathways and Transcription Factors in Neurospora crassa.,"Maintenance of cell integrity and cell-to-cell communication are fundamental biological processes. Filamentous fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, depend on communication to locate compatible cells, coordinate cell fusion, and establish a robust hyphal network. Two MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways are essential for communication and cell fusion in N. crassa: the cell wall integrity/MAK-1 pathway and the MAK-2 (signal response) pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated several points of cross-talk between the MAK-1 and MAK-2 pathways, which is likely necessary for coordinating chemotropic growth toward an extracellular signal, and then mediating cell fusion. Canonical MAPK pathways begin with signal reception and end with a transcriptional response. Two transcription factors, ADV-1 and PP-1, are essential for communication and cell fusion. PP-1 is the conserved target of MAK-2, but it is unclear what targets ADV-1. We did RNA sequencing on Deltaadv-1, Deltapp-1, and wild-type cells and found that ADV-1 and PP-1 have a shared regulon including many genes required for communication, cell fusion, growth, development, and stress response. We identified ADV-1 and PP-1 binding sites across the genome by adapting the in vitro method of DNA-affinity purification sequencing for N. crassa To elucidate the regulatory network, we misexpressed each transcription factor in each upstream MAPK deletion mutant. Misexpression of adv-1 was sufficient to fully suppress the phenotype of the Deltapp-1 mutant and partially suppress the phenotype of the Deltamak-1 mutant. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the MAK-1/ADV-1 and MAK-2/PP-1 pathways form a tight regulatory network that maintains cell integrity and mediates communication and cell fusion.","['DAP-seq', 'MAP kinase', 'Neurospora crassa', 'cell fusion', 'cell-to-cell communication', 'regulatory networks']",Genetics,California 94720-3102,2018 Jun

We carried out an extensive genetic analysis on the role of these four transglycosylases in cell wall biogenesis and demonstrated that the transglycosylases are required for the formation of a normal cell wall. As suggested by the proteomic analysis, we found that multiple transglycosylases were being expressed in N. crassa cells and that different combinations of the enzymes are required in different cell types. The combination of GEL-1, GEL-2 and GEL-5 is required for the growth of vegetative hyphae, while the GEL-1, GEL-2, GEL-3 combination is needed for the production of aerial hyphae and conidia. Our data demonstrates that the enzymes are redundant with partially overlapping enzymatic activities, which provides the fungus with a robust cell wall biosynthetic system. Characterization of the transglycosylase-deficient mutants demonstrated that the incorporation of cell wall proteins was severely compromised. Interestingly, we found that the transglycosylase-deficient mutant cell walls contained more beta-1,3-glucan than the wild type cell wall. Our results demonstrate that the GH72 transglycosylases are not needed for the incorporation of beta-1,3-glucan into the cell wall, but they are required for the incorporation of cell wall glycoprotein into the cell wall.","['Cell wall protein', 'Fungal cell wall', 'Glucan', 'Glucanosyl hydrolase', 'Glucanosyl transferase', 'Neurospora crassa']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,United States,2017 Apr

30307372,LET dependence on killing effect and mutagenicity in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.,"PURPOSE: To assess the unique biological effects of different forms of ionizing radiation causing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), we compared the killing effect, mutagenesis frequency, and mutation type spectrum using the model filamentous fungus Neurospora. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Asexual spores of wild-type Neurospora and two DSB repair-deficient strains [one homologous recombination- and the other non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway-deficient] were irradiated with argon (Ar)-ion beams, ferrous (Fe)-ion beams, or X-rays. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), forward mutation frequencies at the ad-3 loci, and mutation spectra at the ad-3B gene were determined. RESULTS: The canonical NHEJ (cNHEJ)-deficient strain showed resistance to higher X-ray doses, while other strains showed dose-dependent sensitivity. In contrast, the killing effects of Ar-ion and Fe-ion beam irradiation were dose-dependent in all strains tested. The rank order of RBE was Ar-ion > Fe-ion > C-ion. Deletion mutations were the most common, but deletion size incremented with the increasing value of linear energy transfer (LET). CONCLUSIONS: We found marked differences in killing effect of a cNHEJ-deficient mutant between X-ray and high-LET ion beam irradiations (Ar and Fe). The mutation spectra also differed between irradiation types. These differences may be due to the physical properties of each radiation and the repair mechanism of induced damage in Neurospora crassa. These results may guide the choice of irradiation beam to kill or mutagenize fungi for agricultural applications or further research.","['High-LET ion beam', 'homologous recombination repair', 'large deletion', 'multiple mutations', 'non-homologous end-joining']",International journal of radiation biology,Japan,2018 Dec
29203212,Transcriptional basis of enhanced photoinduction of carotenoid biosynthesis at low temperature in the fungus Neurospora crassa.,"Stimulation by light of carotenoid biosynthesis in the mycelia of the fungus Neurospora crassa starts with transient transcriptional induction of the structural genes of the pathway triggered by the White Collar photoreceptor complex. Most studies on this process were carried out under standard growth conditions, but photoinduced carotenoid accumulation is more efficient if the fungus is incubated at low temperatures, from 6 to 12  degrees C. We have investigated the transcriptional photoresponse at 8  degrees C of the genes for proteins that participate in the carotenoid pathway. Exposure to light pulses of different light intensities revealed higher sensitivity if the mycelia were subsequently incubated at 8  degrees C compared to 30  degrees C. Illumination of precooled mycelia resulted in delayed kinetics of mRNA accumulation for the structural genes, and high mRNA accumulation for a longer time. Additionally, after a light pulse, stronger reduction in mRNAs for carotenoid genes was observed at 30  degrees C compared to 8  degrees C. A similar pattern was found for mRNAs of the photoreceptor genes wc-1 and vvd, the latter involved in photoadaptation. These results suggest that the increased efficiency in carotenoid photoinduction at low temperature is due to the higher mRNA levels of the structural genes under these conditions.","['Albino genes', 'Carotenoids', 'Photoadaptation', 'Photoinduction', 'Vivid', 'White Collar']",Research in microbiology,Spain.

Hitherto, the mechanisms of CHSs traffic and sorting from synthesis to delivery sites remain largely unexplored.

Here, we analyzed the role of CSE-7, N. crassa Chs7p orthologue, in the biogenesis of CHS-4 (orthologue of Chs3p). In a N. crassa Deltacse-7 mutant, CHS-4-GFP no longer accumulated at the SPK and septa. Instead, fluorescence was retained in hyphal subapical regions in an extensive network of elongated cisternae (NEC) referred to previously as tubular vacuoles. In a complemented strain expressing a copy of cse-7 the localization of CHS-4-GFP at the SPK and septa was restored, providing evidence that CSE-7 is necessary for the localization of CHS-4 at hyphal tips and septa. CSE-7 was revealed at delimited regions of the ER at the immediacies of nuclei, at the NEC, and remarkably also at septa and the SPK. The organization of the NEC was dependent on the cytoskeleton. SEC-63, an extensively used ER marker, and NCA-1, a SERCA-type ATPase previously localized at the nuclear envelope, were used as markers to discern the nature of the membranes containing CSE-7. Both SEC-63 and NCA-1 were found at the nuclear envelope, but also at regions of the NEC. However, at the NEC only NCA-1 co-localized extensively with CSE-7. Observations by transmission electron microscopy revealed abundant rough ER sheets and distinct electron translucent smooth flattened cisternae, which could correspond collectively to the NEC, thorough the subapical cytoplasm.

To define genes directly regulated by CLR-1, CLR-2, and XLR-1, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing (ChIPseq) on epitope-tagged constructs of these three transcription factors. When N. crassa is exposed to plant cell wall material, CLR-1, CLR-2, and XLR-1 individually bind to the promoters of the most strongly induced genes in their respective regulons. These include promoters of genes encoding cellulases for CLR-1 and CLR-2 (CLR-1/CLR-2) and promoters of genes encoding hemicellulases for XLR-1. CLR-1 bound to its regulon under noninducing conditions; however, this binding alone did not translate into gene expression and enzyme secretion. Motif analysis of the bound genes revealed conserved DNA binding motifs, with the CLR-2 motif matching that of its closest paralog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Gal4p. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that CLR-1 and CLR-2 act in a homocomplex but not as a CLR-1/CLR-2 heterocomplex. IMPORTANCE: Understanding fungal regulation of complex plant cell wall deconstruction pathways in response to multiple environmental signals via interconnected transcriptional circuits provides insight into fungus/plant interactions and eukaryotic nutrient sensing. Coordinated optimization of these regulatory networks is likely required for optimal microbial enzyme production.",?,mBio,USA,2015 Oct 13
31249477,What is Phase in Cellular Clocks?,"Four inter-related measures of phase are described to study the phase synchronization of cellular oscillators, and computation of these measures is described and illustrated on single cell fluorescence data from the model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa. One of these four measures is the phase shift varphi in a sinusoid of the form x(t) = A(cos(omegat + varphi), where t is time. The other measures arise by creating a replica of the periodic process x(t) called the Hilbert transform xÌƒ(t), which is 90 degrees out of phase with the original process x(t). The second phase measure is the phase angle F(H)(t) between the replica xÌƒ(t) and x(t), taking values between -pi and pi. At extreme values the Hilbert Phase is discontinuous, and a continuous form F(C)(t) of the Hilbert Phase is used, measuring time on the nonnegative real axis (t). The continuous Hilbert Phase F(C)(t) is used to define the phase M(C)(t(1),t(0)) for an experiment beginning at time t(0) and ending at time t(1). In that phase differences at time t(0) are often of ancillary interest, the Hilbert Phase F(C)(t(0)) is subtracted from F(C)(t(1)). This difference is divided by 2pi to obtain the phase M(C)(t(1),t(0)) in cycles. Both the Hilbert Phase F(C)(t) and the phase M(C)(t(1),t(0)) are functions of time and useful in studying when oscillators phase-synchronize in time in signal processing and circadian rhythms in particular. The phase of cellular clocks is fundamentally different from circadian clocks at the macroscopic scale because there is an hourly cycle superimposed on the circadian cycle.","['Hilbert Phase', 'Neurospora crassa', 'circadian rhythms', 'phase', 'single cell measurements', 'synchronization']",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,GA,2019 Jun
27449058,Modulation of Circadian Gene Expression and Metabolic Compensation by the RCO-1 Corepressor of Neurospora crassa.,"Neurospora crassa is a model organism for the study of circadian clocks, molecular machineries that confer  approximately 24-hr rhythms to different processes at the cellular and organismal levels. The FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein is a central component of the Neurospora core clock, a transcription/translation negative feedback loop that controls genome-wide rhythmic gene expression. A genetic screen aimed at determining new components involved in the latter process identified regulation of conidiation 1 (rco-1), the ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tup1 corepressor, as affecting period length. By employing bioluminescent transcriptional and translational fusion reporters, we evaluated frq and FRQ expression levels in the rco-1 mutant background observing that, in contrast to prior reports, frq and FRQ expression are robustly rhythmic in the absence of RCO-1, although both amplitude and period length of the core clock are affected. Moreover, we detected a defect in metabolic compensation, such that high-glucose concentrations in the medium result in a significant decrease in period when RCO-1 is absent. Proteins physically interacting with RCO-1 were identified through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry; these include several components involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription, some of which, when absent, lead to a slight change in period. In the aggregate, these results indicate a dual role for RCO-1: although it is not essential for core-clock function, it regulates proper period and amplitude of core-clock dynamics and is also required for the rhythmic regulation of several clock-controlled genes.","['Neurospora crassa', 'circadian clocks', 'core-clock mechanism', 'corepressor', 'frequency']",Genetics,Chile,2016 Sep
26212074,"The phenotype of a phospholipase C (plc-1) mutant in a filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa.","In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, phospholipase C may play a role in hyphal extension at the growing tips as part of a growth-sensing mechanism that activates calcium release from internal stores to mediate continued expansion of the hyphal tip. One candidate for a tip-localized phospholipase C is PLC-1. We characterized morphology and growth characteristics of a knockout mutant (KO plc-1) and a RIP mutated strain (RIP plc-1) (missense mutations and a nonsense mutation render the gene product non-functional). Growth and hyphal cytology of wildtype and KO plc-1 were similar, but the RIP plc-1 mutant grew slower and exhibited abnormal membrane structures at the hyphal tip, imaged using the fluorescence dye FM4-64. To test for causes of the slower growth of the RIP plc-1 mutant, we examined its physiological poise compared to wildtype and the KO plc-1 mutant. The electrical properties of all three strains and the electrogenic contribution of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (identified by cyanide inhibition) were the same. Responses to high osmolarity were also similar. However, the RIP plc-1 mutant had a significantly lower turgor, a possible cause of its slower growth. While growth of all three strains was inhibited by the phospholipase C inhibitor 3-nitrocoumarin, the RIP plc-1 mutant did not exhibit hyphal bursting after addition of the inhibitor, observed in both wildtype and the KO plc-1 mutant. Although the plc-1 gene is not obligatory for tip growth, the phenotype of the RIP plc-1 mutant - abnormal tip cytology, lower turgor and resistance to inhibitor-induced hyphal bursting - suggest it does play a role in tip growth. The expression of a dysfunctional plc-1 gene may cause a shift to alternative mechanism(s) of growth sensing in hyphal extension.","['Electrophysiology', 'Fluorescence imaging', 'Hyphal tip growth', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Phospholipase C', 'Turgor']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Canada.

26771905,"The LSH/DDM1 Homolog MUS-30 Is Required for Genome Stability, but Not for DNA Methylation in Neurospora crassa.","LSH/DDM1 enzymes are required for DNA methylation in higher eukaryotes and have poorly defined roles in genome maintenance in yeast, plants, and animals. The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a tractable system that encodes a single LSH/DDM1 homolog (NCU06306). We report that the Neurospora LSH/DDM1 enzyme is encoded by mutagen sensitive-30 (mus-30), a locus identified in a genetic screen over 25 years ago. We show that MUS-30-deficient cells have normal DNA methylation, but are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. MUS-30 is a nuclear protein, consistent with its predicted role as a chromatin remodeling enzyme, and levels of MUS-30 are increased following DNA damage. MUS-30 co-purifies with Neurospora WDR76, a homolog of yeast Changed Mutation Rate-1 and mammalian WD40 repeat domain 76. Deletion of wdr76 rescued DNA damage-hypersensitivity of Deltamus-30 strains, demonstrating that the MUS-30-WDR76 interaction is functionally important. DNA damage-sensitivity of Deltamus-30 is partially suppressed by deletion of methyl adenine glycosylase-1, a component of the base excision repair machinery (BER); however, the rate of BER is not affected in Deltamus-30 strains. We found that MUS-30-deficient cells are not defective for DSB repair, and we observed a negative genetic interaction between Deltamus-30 and Deltamei-3, the Neurospora RAD51 homolog required for homologous recombination. Together, our findings suggest that MUS-30, an LSH/DDM1 homolog, is required to prevent DNA damage arising from toxic base excision repair intermediates.

24371173,Molecular analysis of intragenic recombination at the tryptophan synthetase locus in Neurospora crassa.,"Fifteen different classically generated and mapped mutations at the tryptophan synthetase locus in Neurospora crassa have been characterized to the level of the primary sequence of the gene. This sequence analysis has demonstrated that intragenic recombination is accurate to order mutations within one open reading frame. While classic genetic analysis correctly ordered the mutations, the position of mutations characterized by gene sequence analysis was more accurate. A leaky mutation was found to have a wild-type primary sequence. The presence of unique polymorphisms in the primary sequence of the trp-3 gene from strain 861 confirms that it has a unique history relative to the other strains studied.

Despite the importance of these organisms in industry, relatively little is known about the filamentous fungal secretory pathway or how it might be manipulated for improved protein production. Here, we use Neurospora crassa as a model filamentous fungus to interrogate the requirements for trafficking of cellulase enzymes from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. We characterized the localization and interaction properties of the p24 and ERV-29 cargo adaptors, as well as their role in cellulase enzyme trafficking. We find that the two most abundantly secreted cellulases, CBH-1 and CBH-2, depend on distinct ER cargo adaptors for efficient exit from the ER. CBH-1 depends on the p24 proteins, whereas CBH-2 depends on the N. crassa homolog of yeast Erv29p.

29908565,Disruption of gul-1 decreased the culture viscosity and improved protein secretion in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.,"BACKGROUND: The cellulolytic fungus Neurospora crassa is considered a potential host for enzyme and bioethanol production. However, large scale applications are hindered by its filamentous growth. Although previous investigations have shown that mycelial morphology in submerged culture can be controlled by altering physical factors, there is little knowledge available about the potential for morphology control by genetic modification. RESULTS: In this study, we screened morphological mutants in the filamentous fungus N. crassa. Of the 90 morphological mutants screened, 14 mutants exhibited considerably higher viscosity compared with that of the wild type strain, and only two mutants showed low-viscosity morphologies in submerged culture. We observed that disruption of gul-1 (NCU01197), which encodes an mRNA binding protein involved in cell wall remodeling, caused pellet formation as the fermentation progressed, and resulted in the most significant decrease in viscosity of culture broth. Moreover, over-expression of gul-1 caused dramatically increased viscosity, suggesting that the gul-1 had an important function in mycelial morphology during submerged cultivation. Transcriptional profiling showed that expression of genes encoding eight GPI-anchored cell wall proteins was lowered in Deltagul-1 while expression of genes associated with two non-anchored cell wall proteins was elevated. Meanwhile, the expression levels of two hydrophobin genes were also significantly altered. These results suggested that GUL-1 affected the transcription of cell wall-related genes, thereby influencing cell wall structure and mycelial morphology. Additionally, the deletion of gul-1 caused increased protein secretion, probably due to a defect in cell wall integrity, suggesting this as an alternative strategy of strain improvement for enzyme production. To confirm practical applications, deletion of gul-1 in the hyper-cellulase producing strain (âˆ†ncw-1âˆ†Ncap3m) significantly reduced the viscosity of culture broth. CONCLUSIONS: Using the model filamentous fungus N. crassa, genes that affect mycelial morphology in submerged culture were explored through systematic screening of morphological mutants. Disrupting several candidate genes altered viscosities in submerged culture. This work provides an example for controlling fungal morphology in submerged fermentation by genetic engineering, and will be beneficial for industrial fungal strain improvement.","['Mycelial morphology', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Pellet', 'Protein secretion', 'Viscosity']",Microbial cell factories,China,2018 Jun 16
24120530,Proteomic alterations induced by ionic liquids in Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa.,"This study constitutes the first attempt to understand at the proteomic level the fungal response to ionic liquid stress. Ascomycota are able to grow in media supplemented with high concentrations of an ionic liquid, which, in turn, lead to major alterations in the fungal metabolic footprint. Herein, we analysed the differential accumulation of mycelial proteins in Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa after their exposure to two of the most commonly used ionic liquids: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride or cholinium chloride. Data obtained showed that numerous stress-responsive proteins (e.g. anti-ROS defence proteins) as well as several critical biological processes and/or pathways were affected by either ionic liquid. Amongst other changes, these compounds altered developmental programmes in both fungi (e.g. promoting the development of Hulle cells or conidiation) and led to accumulation of osmolytes, some of which may play an important role in multiple stress responses. In particular, in N. crassa, both ionic liquids increased the levels of proteins which are likely involved in the biosynthesis of unusual metabolites. These data potentially open new perspectives on ionic liquid research, furthering their conscious design and their use to trigger production of targeted metabolites. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present study emphasises the importance of understanding ionic liquid's stress responses, crucial to further their safe large-scale usage. Knowledge of the alterations prompted at a cellular and biochemical level gives also fresh perspectives on how to employ these ""novel"" compounds to manipulate proteins or pathways of biotechnological value. The results presented here provide meaningful insights into the understanding of fungi stress and adaptation responses to anthropogenic chemicals used in industry.","['Aspergillus nidulans', 'Autolysis', 'Ionic liquid', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Osmolytes', 'Proteomics']",Journal of proteomics,Portugal,2013 Dec 6
27019426,Calcineurin Subunits A and B Interact to Regulate Growth and Asexual and Sexual Development in Neurospora crassa.,"Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase in eukaryotes that consists of a catalytic subunit A and a regulatory subunit B. Previous studies in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa had suggested that the catalytic subunit of calcineurin might be an essential protein. We generated N. crassa strains expressing the A (cna-1) and B (cnb-1) subunit genes under the regulation of Ptcu-1, a copper-responsive promoter. In these strains, addition of bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS), a copper chelator, results in induction of cna-1 and cnb-1, while excess Cu2+ represses gene expression. Through analysis of these strains under repressing and inducing conditions, we found that the calcineurin is required for normal growth, asexual development and female fertility in N. crassa. Moreover, we isolated and analyzed cnb-1 mutant alleles generated by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), with the results further supporting roles for calcineurin in growth and fertility in N. crassa.

However, only one positive selection marker was used in the cassette. A tedious subsequent procedure was needed to purify homokaryons due to the lack of a negative selection after cassette eviction. Additionally, the endoxylanase xylP promoter from Penicillium chrysogenum used in the construct was not strongly regulated in N. crassa, which led to low efficiency in cassette eviction.

In Neurospora crassa, light promotes the interaction of WCCs and their binding to the promoters to activate transcription. In Aspergillus nidulans, the WCC and the phytochrome interact to coordinate gene transcription and other responses, but the contribution of these photoreceptors to fungal photobiology varies across fungal species.

Sextuple bgl deletion strains expressing one of the three basally transcribed bgls did not produce any detectable BGL activity when they were grown on Avicel. BGL6 is the major contributor to overall BGL activity, and most of its activity resides cell-bound.

It is mostly in vitro analysis using their recombinant enzymes that has revealed their starter and product specificities. Of these, CsyB was found to be a new kind of type III PKS that catalyses the coupling of two beta-keto fatty acyl CoAs.

26194204,Metabolic Impacts of Using Nitrogen and Copper-Regulated Promoters to Regulate Gene Expression in Neurospora crassa.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a long-studied eukaryotic microbial system amenable to heterologous expression of native and foreign proteins. However, relatively few highly tunable promoters have been developed for this species. In this study, we compare the tcu-1 and nit-6 promoters for controlled expression of a GFP reporter gene in N. crassa. Although the copper-regulated tcu-1 has been previously characterized, this is the first investigation exploring nitrogen-controlled nit-6 for expression of heterologous genes in N. crassa. We determined that fragments corresponding to 1.5-kb fragments upstream of the tcu-1 and nit-6 open reading frames are needed for optimal repression and expression of GFP mRNA and protein. nit-6 was repressed using concentrations of glutamine from 2 to 20 mM and induced in medium containing 0.5-20 mM nitrate as the nitrogen source. Highest levels of expression were achieved within 3 hr of induction for each promoter and GFP mRNA could not be detected within 1 hr after transfer to repressing conditions using the nit-6 promoter. We also performed metabolic profiling experiments using proton NMR to identify changes in metabolite levels under inducing and repressing conditions for each promoter. The results demonstrate that conditions used to regulate tcu-1 do not significantly change the primary metabolome and that the differences between inducing and repressing conditions for nit-6 can be accounted for by growth under nitrate or glutamine as a nitrogen source. Our findings demonstrate that nit-6 is a tunable promoter that joins tcu-1 as a choice for regulation of gene expression in N. crassa.","['NMR', 'heterologous gene expression', 'inducible promoter', 'metabolic profiling', 'metabolomics']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",China,2015 Jul 20

In humans, LIS1 is required for proper nuclear and organelle migration during cell growth. Although gene duplication is absent from Neurospora crassa, we found two paralogues of human LIS1. We named them LIS1-1 and LIS1-2 and studied their dynamics and function by fluorescent tagging. At the protein level, LIS1-1 and LIS1-2 were very similar. Although, the characteristic coiled-coil motif was not present in LIS1-2. LIS1-1-GFP and LIS1-2-GFP showed the same cellular distribution and dynamics, but LIS1-2-GFP was less abundant. Both LIS1 proteins were found in the subapical region as single fluorescent particles traveling toward the cell apex, they accumulated in the apical dome forming prominent short filament-like structures, some of which traversed the Spitzenkorper (Spk). The fluorescent structures moved exclusively in anterograde fashion along straight paths suggesting they traveled on Mts. There was no effect in the filament behavior of LIS1-1-GFP in the Deltalis1-2 mutant but the dynamics of LIS1-2-GFP was affected in the Deltalis1-1 mutant. Microtubular integrity and the dynein-dynactin complex were necessary for the formation of filament-like structures of LIS1-1-GFP in the subapical and apical regions; however, conventional kinesin (KIN-1) was not. Deletion mutants showed that the lack of lis1-1 decreased cell growth by  approximately 75%; however, the lack of lis1-2 had no effect on growth. A Deltalis1-1;Deltalis1-2 double mutant showed slower growth than either single mutant. Conidia production was reduced but branching rate increased in Deltalis1-1 and the Deltalis1-1;Deltalis1-2 double mutants. The absence of LIS1-1 had a strong effect on Mt organization and dynamics and indirectly affected nuclear and mitochondrial distribution. The absence of LIS1-1 filaments in dynein mutants (ropy mutants) or in benomyl treated hyphae indicates the strong association between this protein and the regulation of the dynein-dynactin complex and Mt organization. LIS1-1 and LIS1-2 had a high amino acid homology, nevertheless, the absence of the coiled-coil motif in LIS1-2 suggests that its function or regulation may be distinct from that of LIS1-1.","['+TIP proteins', 'Dynein-dynactin', 'LIS1', 'Microtubules', 'Neurospora crassa']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2015 Sep
29421311,Cross-pathway control gene CPC1/GCN4 coordinates with histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to regulate catalase-3 expression under oxidative stress in Neurospora crassa.,"Catalase is an important enzyme found in nearly all aerobic organisms and plays an essential role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by catalyzing the degradation of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. In filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the expression levels of catalases are rigorously regulated by morphogenetic transition during growth and development in cells. Our study revealed that catalase-3 transcription is positively regulated by histone acetyltransferase GCN5 and the cross-pathway control gene cpc-1, as the cat-3 expression level is significantly decreased in gcn5(KO) and cpc-1 (j-5) mutants. Moreover, gcn5(KO) and cpc-1 (j-5) mutants could not respond to H(2)O(2) treatment due to the inadequate cat-3 transcription, while wild-type strains showed high expression levels of catalase upon H(2)O(2) treatment. The global H3 acetylation and the acetylation of H3 at cat-3 locus dramatically decreased in gcn5(KO) under normal or oxidative stress conditions. Meanwhile, the expression of CAT-3 is reduced in gcn5(E146Q), the catalytically dead mutant, suggesting that the catalytic activity of GCN5 functions in regulation of cat-3 transcription. In addition, GCN5 cannot acetylate histone H3 efficiently at cat-3 locus in cpc-1 (j-5) mutant strains under normal or oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, ChIP assays data revealed that the CPC1/GCN4 can directly target the cat-3 promoter region, which may recruit GCN5 to modify the histone acetylation of this region. These results disclosed a distinctive function of CPC1/GCN4 in the regulatory pathway of cat-3 transcription, which is mediated by GCN5-dependent acetylation.","['CPC1/GCN4', 'Catalase-3', 'GCN5', 'Histone acetylation', 'Neurospora crassa']",Free radical biology & medicine,China,2018 Mar

While a consensus has yet to be reached on their global importance, an increasing number of examples have been shown to be functional, regulating gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Here, we use RNA sequencing data from the ABI SOLiD platform to identify lncRNA and NATs obtained from samples of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa grown under different light and temperature conditions. We identify 939 novel lncRNAs, of which 477 are antisense to annotated genes. Across the whole dataset, the extent of overlap between sense and antisense transcripts is large: 371 sense/antisense transcripts are complementary over 500 nts or more and 236 overlap by more than 1000 nts. Most prevalent are 3' end overlaps between convergently transcribed sense/antisense pairs, but examples of divergently transcribed pairs and nested transcripts are also present. We confirm the expression of a subset of sense/antisense transcript pairs by qPCR. We examine the size, types of overlap and expression levels under the different environmental stimuli of light and temperature, and identify 11 lncRNAs that are up-regulated in response to light. We also find differences in transcript length and the position of introns between protein-coding transcripts that have antisense expression and transcripts with no antisense expression.

28599643,Regulation of the reserve carbohydrate metabolism by alkaline pH and calcium in Neurospora crassa reveals a possible cross-regulation of both signaling pathways.,"BACKGROUND: Glycogen and trehalose are storage carbohydrates and their levels in microorganisms vary according to environmental conditions. In Neurospora crassa, alkaline pH stress highly influences glycogen levels, and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the response to pH stress also involves the calcineurin signaling pathway mediated by the Crz1 transcription factor. Recently, in yeast, pH stress response genes were identified as targets of Crz1 including genes involved in glycogen and trehalose metabolism. In this work, we present evidence that in N. crassa the glycogen and trehalose metabolism is modulated by alkaline pH and calcium stresses. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the pH signaling pathway in N. crassa controls the accumulation of the reserve carbohydrates glycogen and trehalose via the PAC-3 transcription factor, which is the central regulator of the signaling pathway. The protein binds to the promoters of most of the genes encoding enzymes of glycogen and trehalose metabolism and regulates their expression. We also demonstrated that the reserve carbohydrate levels and gene expression are both modulated under calcium stress and that the response to calcium stress may involve the concerted action of PAC-3. Calcium activates growth of the Deltapac-3 strain and influences its glycogen and trehalose accumulation. In addition, calcium stress differently regulates glycogen and trehalose metabolism in the mutant strain compared to the wild-type strain. While glycogen levels are decreased in both strains, the trehalose levels are significantly increased in the wild-type strain and not affected by calcium in the mutant strain when compared to mycelium not exposed to calcium. CONCLUSIONS: We previously reported the role of PAC-3 as a transcription factor involved in glycogen metabolism regulation by controlling the expression of the gsn gene, which encodes an enzyme of glycogen synthesis. In this work, we extended the investigation by studying in greater detail the effects of pH on the metabolism of the reserve carbohydrate glycogen and trehalose. We also demonstrated that calcium stress affects the reserve carbohydrate levels and the response to calcium stress may require PAC-3. Considering that the reserve carbohydrate metabolism may be subjected to different signaling pathways control, our data contribute to the understanding of the N. crassa responses under pH and calcium stresses.","['Calcium stress', 'Glycogen', 'Neurospora crassa', 'PAC-3 transcription factor', 'Trehalose', 'pH signaling pathway']",BMC genomics,Brazil,2017 Jun 9
23835025,Sulfur-regulated control of the met-2(+) gene of Neurospora crassa encoding cystathionine beta-lyase.,"BACKGROUND: Cystathionine beta-lyase performs an essential role in the transsulfuration pathway by its primary reaction of forming homocysteine from cystathionine. Understanding how the Neurospora crassa met-2(+) gene, which encodes cystathionine beta-lyase, is regulated is important in determining the basis of the cellular control of transsulfuration. The aim of this study was to determine the nature of a potential regulatory connection of met-2(+) to the Neurospora sulfur regulatory network. FINDINGS: The cystathionine beta-lyase (met-2(+)) gene was cloned by the identification of a cosmid genomic clone capable of transforming a met-2 mutant to methionine prototrophy and subsequently characterized. The gene contains a single intron and encodes a protein of 457 amino acids with conserved residues predicted to be important for catalysis and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate co-factor binding. The expression of met-2(+) in wild-type N. crassa increased 3.1-fold under sulfur-limiting growth conditions as compared to the transcript levels seen under high sulfur growth conditions (i.e., repressing conditions). In a Deltacys-3 strain, met-2(+) transcript levels were substantially reduced under either low- or high-sulfur growth conditions. In addition, the presence of CYS3 activator binding sites on the met-2(+) promoter was demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays. CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we demonstrate the sulfur-regulated expression of the met-2(+) gene and confirm its connection to the N. crassa sulfur regulatory circuit by the reduced expression observed in a Deltacys-3 mutant and the in vitro detection of CYS3 binding sites in the met-2(+) promoter. The data further adds to our understanding of the regulatory dynamics of transsulfuration.",?,BMC research notes,USA,2013 Jul 8
26956589,The Fast-Evolving phy-2 Gene Modulates Sexual Development in Response to Light in the Model Fungus Neurospora crassa.,"Rapid responses to changes in incident light are critical to the guidance of behavior and development in most species. Phytochrome light receptors in particular play key roles in bacterial physiology and plant development, but their functions and regulation are less well understood in fungi. Nevertheless, genome-wide expression measurements provide key information that can guide experiments that reveal how genes respond to environmental signals and clarify their role in development. We performed functional genomic and phenotypic analyses of the two phytochromes in Neurospora crassa, a fungal model adapted to a postfire environment that experiences dramatically variable light conditions. Expression of phy-1 and phy-2 was low in early sexual development and in the case of phy-2 increased in late sexual development. Under light stimulation, strains with the phytochromes deleted exhibited increased expression of sexual development-related genes. Moreover, under red light, the phy-2 knockout strain commenced sexual development early. In the evolution of phytochromes within ascomycetes, at least two duplications have occurred, and the faster-evolving phy-2 gene has frequently been lost. Additionally, the three key cysteine sites that are critical for bacterial and plant phytochrome function are not conserved within fungal phy-2 homologs. Through the action of phytochromes, transitions between asexual and sexual reproduction are modulated by light level and light quality, presumably as an adaptation for fast asexual growth and initiation of sexual reproduction of N. crassa in exposed postfire ecosystems. IMPORTANCE: Environmental signals, including light, play critical roles in regulating fungal growth and pathogenicity, and balance of asexual and sexual reproduction is critical in fungal pathogens' incidence, virulence, and distribution. Red light sensing by phytochromes is well known to play critical roles in bacterial physiology and plant development. Homologs of phytochromes were first discovered in the fungal model Neurospora crassa and then subsequently in diverse other fungi, including many plant pathogens. Our study investigated the evolution of red light sensors in ascomycetes and confirmed-using the model fungus Neurospora crassa-their roles in modulating the asexual-sexual reproduction balance in fungi. Our findings also provide a key insight into one of the most poorly understood aspects of fungal biology, suggesting that further study of the function of phytochromes in fungi is critical to reveal the genetic basis of the asexual-sexual switch responsible for fungal growth and distribution, including diverse and destructive plant pathogens.",?,mBio,USA,2016 Mar 8
24492881,A kinetic study of the effects of light on circadian rhythmicity of the frq promoter of Neurospora crassa.,"The role of the frq gene in the Neurospora crassa circadian rhythm has been widely studied, but technical limitations have hindered a thorough analysis of frq circadian expression waveform. Through our experiments, we have shown an improved precision in defining Neurospora's circadian rhythm kinetics using a codon optimized firefly luciferase gene reporter linked to a frq promoter. In vivo examination of this real-time reporter has allowed for a better understanding of the relationship of the light responsive elements of the frq promoter to its circadian feedback components. We provide a detailed phase response curve showing the phase shifts induced by a light pulse applied at different points of the circadian cycle. Using the frq-luc reporter, we have found that a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle (12L:12D) results in a luciferase expression waveform that is more complex and higher in amplitude than that seen in free-running conditions of constant darkness (DD). When using a lighting regime more consistent with solar timing, rather than a square wave pattern, one observes a circadian waveform that is smoother, lower in amplitude, and different in phasing. Using dim light in place of darkness in these experiments also affects the resulting waveform and phasing. Our experiments illustrate Neurospora's circadian kinetics in greater detail than previous methods, providing further insight into the complex underlying biochemical, genetic, and physiological mechanisms underpinning the circadian oscillator.","['Neurospora', 'PRC', 'PTC', 'VIVID', 'WCC', 'circadian', 'entrainment', 'frq', 'luminescence']",Journal of biological rhythms,USA,2014 Feb

RESULTS: Neurospora crassa ncw-1 encodes a non-anchored cell wall protein. The absence of ncw-1 increased cellulase gene expression and this is not due to relieving carbon catabolite repression mediated by the cre-1 pathway. A mutant lacking genes encoding both three major beta-glucosidase enzymes and NCW-1 (Delta3betaGDeltancw-1) was constructed. Transcriptome analysis of the quadruple mutant demonstrated enhanced expression of cellodextrin transporters after ncw-1 deletion, indicating that ncw-1 affects cellulase expression and production by inhibiting the uptake of the cellodextrin. CONCLUSIONS: NCW-1 is a novel component that plays a critical role in the cellulase induction signaling pathway.","['Cell wall protein', 'Cellobiose uptake', 'Cellodextrin transporter', 'Cellulase induction', 'Neurospora crassa']",Biotechnology letters,China,2017 Apr

23648483,"Novel insights into the role of Neurospora crassa NDUFAF2, an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial complex I assembly factor.","Complex I deficiency is commonly associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation diseases. Mutations in nuclear genes encoding structural subunits or assembly factors of complex I have been increasingly identified as the cause of the diseases. One such factor, NDUFAF2, is a paralog of the NDUFA12 structural subunit of the enzyme, but the mechanism by which it exerts its function remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that the Neurospora crassa NDUFAF2 homologue, the 13.4 L protein, is a late assembly factor that associates with complex I assembly intermediates containing the membrane arm and the connecting part but lacking the N module of the enzyme. Furthermore, we provide evidence that dissociation of the assembly factor is dependent on the incorporation of the putative regulatory module composed of the subunits of 13.4 (NDUFA12), 18.4 (NDUFS6), and 21 (NDUFS4) kDa. Our results demonstrate that the 13.4 L protein is a complex I assembly factor functionally conserved from fungi to mammals.",?,Molecular and cellular biology,Portugal,2013 Jul
26132395,The bZIP Transcription Factor HAC-1 Is Involved in the Unfolded Protein Response and Is Necessary for Growth on Cellulose in Neurospora crassa.,"High protein secretion capacity in filamentous fungi requires an extremely efficient system for protein synthesis, folding and transport. When the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is exceeded, a pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered, allowing cells to mitigate and cope with this stress. In yeast, this pathway relies on the transcription factor Hac1, which mediates the up-regulation of several genes required under these stressful conditions. In this work, we identified and characterized the ortholog of the yeast HAC1 gene in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We show that its mRNA undergoes an ER stress-dependent splicing reaction, which in N. crassa removes a 23 nt intron and leads to a change in the open reading frame. By disrupting the N. crassa hac-1 gene, we determined it to be crucial for activating UPR and for proper growth in the presence of ER stress-inducing chemical agents. Neurospora is naturally found growing on dead plant material, composed primarily by lignocellulose, and is a model organism for the study of plant cell wall deconstruction. Notably, we found that growth on cellulose, a substrate that requires secretion of numerous enzymes, imposes major demands on ER function and is dramatically impaired in the absence of hac-1, thus broadening the range of physiological functions of the UPR in filamentous fungi. Growth on hemicellulose however, another carbon source that necessitates the secretion of various enzymes for its deconstruction, is not impaired in the mutant nor is the amount of proteins secreted on this substrate, suggesting that secretion, as a whole, is unaltered in the absence of hac-1. The characterization of this signaling pathway in N. crassa will help in the study of plant cell wall deconstruction by fungi and its manipulation may result in important industrial biotechnological applications.",?,PloS one,Chile,2015
23940790,Analysis of mutations in Neurospora crassa ERMES components reveals specific functions related to beta-barrel protein assembly and maintenance of mitochondrial morphology.,"The endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) tethers the er to mitochondria and contains four structural components: Mmm1, Mdm12, Mdm10, and Mmm2 (Mdm34). The Gem1 protein may play a role in regulating ERMES function. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa strains lacking any of Mmm1, Mdm12, or Mdm10 are known to show a variety of phenotypic defects including altered mitochondrial morphology and defects in the assembly of beta-barrel proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane. Here we examine ERMES complex components in N. crassa and show that Mmm1 is an ER membrane protein containing a Cys residue near its N-terminus that is conserved in the class Sordariomycetes. The residue occurs in the ER-lumen domain of the protein and is involved in the formation of disulphide bonds that give rise to Mmm1 dimers. Dimer formation is required for efficient assembly of Tom40 into the TOM complex. However, no effects are seen on porin assembly or mitochondrial morphology. This demonstrates a specificity of function and suggests a direct role for Mmm1 in Tom40 assembly. Mutation of a highly conserved region in the cytosolic domain of Mmm1 results in moderate defects in Tom40 and porin assembly, as well as a slight morphological phenotype. Previous reports have not examined the role of Mmm2 with respect to mitochondrial protein import and assembly. Here we show that absence of Mmm2 affects assembly of beta-barrel proteins and that lack of any ERMES structural component results in defects in Tom22 assembly. Loss of N. crassa Gem1 has no effect on the assembly of these proteins but does affect mitochondrial morphology.",?,PloS one,Canada,2013
27796528,Identification of critical amino acid residues and functional conservation of the Neurospora crassa and Rattus norvegicus orthologues of neuronal calcium sensor-1.,"Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a member of neuronal calcium sensor family of proteins consisting of an amino terminal myristoylation domain and four conserved calcium (Ca(2+)) binding EF-hand domains. We performed site-directed mutational analysis of three key amino acid residues that are glycine in the conserved site for the N-terminal myristoylation, a conserved glutamic acid residue responsible for Ca(2+) binding in the third EF-hand (EF3), and an unusual non-conserved amino acid arginine at position 175 in the Neurospora crassa NCS-1. The N. crassa strains possessing the ncs-1 mutant allele of these three amino acid residues showed impairment in functions ranging from growth, Ca(2+) stress tolerance, and ultraviolet survival. In addition, heterologous expression of the NCS-1 from Rattus norvegicus in N. crassa confirmed its interspecies functional conservation. Moreover, functions of glutamic acid at position 120, the first Ca(2+) binding residue among all the EF-hands of the R. norvegicus NCS-1 was found conserved. Thus, we identified three critical amino acid residues of N. crassa NCS-1, and demonstrated its functional conservation across species using the orthologue from R. norvegicus.","['Calcium binding', 'EF-hand domain', 'Heterologous expression', 'N-terminal myristoylation', 'Neuronal calcium sensor-1', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Rattus norvegicus', 'Site- directed mutagenesis', 'Ultraviolet survival']",Genetica,India,2016 Dec
29924817,A component of the TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) nutrient-sensing pathway plays a role in circadian rhythmicity in Neurospora crassa.,"The TOR (Target of Rapamycin) pathway is a highly-conserved signaling pathway in eukaryotes that regulates cellular growth and stress responses. The cellular response to amino acids or carbon sources such as glucose requires anchoring of the TOR kinase complex to the lysosomal/vacuolar membrane by the Ragulator (mammals) or EGO (yeast) protein complex. Here we report a connection between the TOR pathway and circadian (daily) rhythmicity. The molecular mechanism of circadian rhythmicity in all eukaryotes has long been thought to be transcription/translation feedback loops (TTFLs). In the model eukaryote Neurospora crassa, a TTFL including FRQ (frequency) and WCC (white collar complex) has been intensively studied. However, it is also well-known that rhythmicity can be seen in the absence of TTFL functioning. We previously isolated uv90 as a mutation that compromises FRQ-less rhythms and also damps the circadian oscillator when FRQ is present. We have now mapped the uv90 gene and identified it as NCU05950, homologous to the TOR pathway proteins EGO1 (yeast) and LAMTOR1 (mammals), and we have named the N. crassa protein VTA (vacuolar TOR-associated protein). The protein is anchored to the outer vacuolar membrane and deletion of putative acylation sites destroys this localization as well as the protein's function in rhythmicity. A deletion of VTA is compromised in its growth responses to amino acids and glucose. We conclude that a key protein in the complex that anchors TOR to the vacuole plays a role in maintaining circadian (daily) rhythmicity. Our results establish a connection between the TOR pathway and circadian rhythms and point towards a network integrating metabolism and the circadian system.",?,PLoS genetics,Canada,2018 Jun
25425138,The Rab GTPase YPT-1 associates with Golgi cisternae and Spitzenkorper microvesicles in Neurospora crassa.,"Vesicle traffic involves budding, transport, tethering and fusion of vesicles with acceptor membranes. GTP-bound small Rab GTPases interact with the membrane of vesicles, promoting their association with other factors before their subsequent fusion. Filamentous fungi contain at their hyphal apex the Spitzenkorper (Spk), a multivesicular structure to which vesicles concentrate before being redirected to specific cell sites. The regulatory mechanisms ensuring the directionality of the vesicles that travel to the Spk are still unknown. Hence, we analyzed YPT-1, the Neurospora crassa homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ypt1p (Rab1), which regulates different secretory pathway events. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed fluorescently tagged YPT-1 at the Spk and putative Golgi cisternae. Co-expression of YPT-1 and predicted post-Golgi Rab GTPases showed YPT-1 confined to the Spk microvesicular core, while SEC-4 (Rab8) and YPT-31 (Rab11) occupied the Spk macrovesicular peripheral layer, suggesting that trafficking and organization of macro and microvesicles at the Spk are regulated by distinct Rabs. Partial colocalization of YPT-1 with USO-1 (p115) and SEC-7 indicated the additional participation of YPT-1 at early and late Golgi trafficking steps.",?,Molecular microbiology,Mexico,2015 Feb

GABA can be produced from the decarboxylation of glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase. In this study, a synthetic scaffold complex strategy was employed involving the Neurospora crassa glutamate decarboxylase (GadB) and Escherichia coli GABA antiporter (GadC) to improve GABA production. To construct the complex, the SH3 domain was attached to the N. crassa GadB, and the SH3 ligand was attached to the N-terminus, middle, and C-terminus of E. coli GadC. In the C-terminus model, 5.8 g/l of GABA concentration was obtained from 10 g/l glutamate. When a competing pathway engineered strain was used, the final GABA concentration was further increased to 5.94 g/l, which corresponds to 97.5% of GABA yield.

29768444,Ensemble methods for stochastic networks with special reference to the biological clock of Neurospora crassa.,"A major challenge in systems biology is to infer the parameters of regulatory networks that operate in a noisy environment, such as in a single cell. In a stochastic regime it is hard to distinguish noise from the real signal and to infer the noise contribution to the dynamical behavior. When the genetic network displays oscillatory dynamics, it is even harder to infer the parameters that produce the oscillations. To address this issue we introduce a new estimation method built on a combination of stochastic simulations, mass action kinetics and ensemble network simulations in which we match the average periodogram and phase of the model to that of the data. The method is relatively fast (compared to Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo Methods), easy to parallelize, applicable to large oscillatory networks and large (~2000 cells) single cell expression data sets, and it quantifies the noise impact on the observed dynamics. Standard errors of estimated rate coefficients are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the mean from single cell experiments with on the order of ~1000 cells. We also provide a method to assess the goodness of fit of the stochastic network using the Hilbert phase of single cells. An analysis of phase departures from the null model with no communication between cells is consistent with a hypothesis of Stochastic Resonance describing single cell oscillators. Stochastic Resonance provides a physical mechanism whereby intracellular noise plays a positive role in establishing oscillatory behavior, but may require model parameters, such as rate coefficients, that differ substantially from those extracted at the macroscopic level from measurements on populations of millions of communicating, synchronized cells.",?,PloS one,Georgia,2018
27029286,"PRD-1, a Component of the Circadian System of Neurospora crassa, Is a Member of the DEAD-box RNA Helicase Family.","The circadian rhythms found in almost all organisms are driven by molecular oscillators, including transcription/translation feedback loops (TTFLs). However, TTFL-independent oscillators can drive rhythms in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The fungus Neurospora crassa is a model organism for studying the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock. Although a circadian TTFL involving the proteins FRQ, WC-1, and WC-2 is well-characterized in N. crassa, rhythms can still be observed in the absence of this feedback loop. These rhythms are said to be driven by 1 or more FRQ-less oscillator(s) (FLOs). The prd-1 mutation lengthens the period in frq wild type and was previously shown to severely disrupt FRQ-less rhythms in frq null mutants under several different conditions; therefore, the prd-1 gene product is a candidate for a component of a FLO. We report here that prd-1 also disrupts free-running rhythms in wc-1 null mutants, confirming its effects on FRQ-less rhythms. We have now mapped and identified the prd-1 gene as NCU07839, a DEAD-box RNA helicase dbp-2 Complementation with the wild-type gene corrects the rhythm defects of the prd-1 mutant in the complete circadian system (when the FRQ-based TTFL is intact) and also the free-running FRQ-less rhythm on low choline. A PRD-1-GFP fusion protein localizes to the nucleus. The prd-1 mutant has a single base pair change in the first base of an intron that results in abnormally spliced transcripts. FRQ-less rhythms on low choline, or entrained to heat pulses, were only marginally affected in strains carrying deletions of 2 other RNA helicases (prd-6 and msp-8).

25849253,Production of cellobionate from cellulose using an engineered Neurospora crassa strain with laccase and redox mediator addition.,"We report a novel production process for cellobionic acid from cellulose using an engineered fungal strain with the exogenous addition of laccase and a redox mediator. A previously engineered strain of Neurospora crassa (F5âˆ†ace-1âˆ†cre-1âˆ†ndvB) was shown to produce cellobionate directly from cellulose without the addition of exogenous cellulases. Specifically, N. crassa produces cellulases, which hydrolyze cellulose to cellobiose, and cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), which oxidizes cellobiose to cellobionate. However, the conversion of cellobiose to cellobionate is limited by the slow re-oxidation of CDH by molecular oxygen. By adding low concentrations of laccase and a redox mediator to the fermentation, CDH can be efficiently oxidized by the redox mediator, with in-situ re-oxidation of the redox mediator by laccase. The conversion of cellulose to cellobionate was optimized by evaluating pH, buffer, and laccase and redox mediator addition time on the yield of cellobionate. Mass and material balances were performed, and the use of the native N. crassa laccase in such a conversion system was evaluated against the exogenous Pleurotus ostreatus laccase. This paper describes a working concept of cellobionate production from cellulose using the CDH-ATBS-laccase system in a fermentation system.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2015

29183256,Experimental and Mathematical Analyses Relating Circadian Period and Phase of Entrainment in Neurospora crassa.,"Circadian rhythms are observed in most organisms on earth and are known to play a major role in successful adaptation to the 24-h cycling environment. Circadian phenotypes are characterized by a free-running period that is observed in constant conditions and an entrained phase that is observed in cyclic conditions. Thus, the relationship between the free-running period and phase of entrainment is of interest. A popular simple rule has been that the entrained phase is the expression of the period in a cycling environment (i.e., that a short period causes an advanced phase and a long period causes a delayed phase). However, there are experimental data that are not explained by this simple relationship, and no systematic study has been done to explore all possible period-phase relationships. Here, we show the existence of stable period-phase relationships that are exceptions to this rule. First, we analyzed period-phase relationships using populations with different degrees of genome complexity. Second, we generated isogenic F1 populations by crossing 14 classical period mutants to the same female and analyzed 2 populations with a short period/delayed phase and a long period/advanced phase. Third, we generated a mathematical model to account for such variable relationships between period and phase. Our analyses support the view that the circadian period of an organism is not the only predictor of the entrained phase.","['ATP-dependent RNA helicase', 'ecotypes', 'familial sleep phase syndrome', 'mathematical model', 'period', 'phase of entrainment', 'thioredoxin reductase']",Journal of biological rhythms,New Jersey,2017 Dec

The role of CRE-1 as the central transcriptional regulator.","The transcription factor CreA/Mig1/CRE-1 is a repressor protein that regulates the use of alternative carbon sources via a mechanism known as Carbon Catabolite Repression (CCR). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mig1 recruits the complex Ssn6-Tup1, the Neurospora crassa RCM-1 and RCO-1 orthologous proteins, respectively, to bind to promoters of glucose-repressible genes. We have been studying the regulation of glycogen metabolism in N. crassa and the identification of the RCO-1 corepressor as a regulator led us to investigate the regulatory role of CRE-1 in this process. Glycogen content is misregulated in the rco-1(KO), rcm-1(RIP) and cre-1(KO) strains, and the glycogen synthase phosphorylation is decreased in all strains, showing that CRE-1, RCO-1 and RCM-1 proteins are involved in glycogen accumulation and in the regulation of GSN activity by phosphorylation. We also confirmed the regulatory role of CRE-1 in CCR and its nuclear localization under repressing condition in N. crassa. The expression of all glycogenic genes is misregulated in the cre-1(KO) strain, suggesting that CRE-1 also controls glycogen metabolism by regulating gene expression. The existence of a high number of the Aspergillus nidulans CreA motif (5'-SYGGRG-3') in the glycogenic gene promoters led us to analyze the binding of CRE-1 to some DNA motifs both in vitro by DNA gel shift and in vivo by ChIP-qPCR analysis.

24928924,BEM46 shows eisosomal localization and association with tryptophan-derived auxin pathway in Neurospora crassa.,"BEM46 proteins are evolutionarily conserved, but their functions remain elusive. We reported previously that the BEM46 protein in Neurospora crassa is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is essential for ascospore germination. In the present study, we established a bem46 knockout strain of N. crassa. This Deltabem46 mutant exhibited a level of ascospore germination lower than that of the wild type but much higher than those of the previously characterized bem46-overexpressing and RNA interference (RNAi) lines. Reinvestigation of the RNAi transformants revealed two types of alternatively spliced bem46 mRNA; expression of either type led to a loss of ascospore germination. Our results indicated that the phenotype was not due to bem46 mRNA downregulation or loss but was caused by the alternatively spliced mRNAs and the peptides they encoded. Using the N. crassa ortholog of the eisosomal protein PILA from Aspergillus nidulans, we further demonstrated the colocalization of BEM46 with eisosomes. Employing the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a single interaction partner: anthranilate synthase component II (encoded by trp-1). This interaction was confirmed in vivo by a split-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) approach. The Deltatrp-1 mutant showed reduced ascospore germination and increased indole production, and we used bioinformatic tools to identify a putative auxin biosynthetic pathway. The genes involved exhibited various levels of transcriptional regulation in the different bem46 transformant and mutant strains. We also investigated the indole production of the strains in different developmental stages. Our findings suggested that the regulation of indole biosynthesis genes was influenced by bem46 overexpression. Furthermore, we uncovered evidence of colocalization of BEM46 with the neutral amino acid transporter MTR.",?,Eukaryotic cell,Germany,2014 Aug
25749367,Carbon and nitrogen limitation increase chitosan antifungal activity in Neurospora crassa and fungal human pathogens.,"Chitosan permeabilizes plasma membrane and kills sensitive filamentous fungi and yeast. Membrane fluidity and cell energy determine chitosan sensitivity in fungi. A five-fold reduction of both glucose (main carbon (C) source) and nitrogen (N) increased 2-fold Neurospora crassa sensitivity to chitosan. We linked this increase with production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and plasma membrane permeabilization. Releasing N. crassa from nutrient limitation reduced chitosan antifungal activity in spite of high ROS intracellular levels. With lactate instead of glucose, C and N limitation increased N. crassa sensitivity to chitosan further (4-fold) than what glucose did. Nutrient limitation also increased sensitivity of filamentous fungi and yeast human pathogens to chitosan. For Fusarium proliferatum, lowering 100-fold C and N content in the growth medium, increased 16-fold chitosan sensitivity. Similar results were found for Candida spp. (including fluconazole resistant strains) and Cryptococcus spp. Severe C and N limitation increased chitosan antifungal activity for all pathogens tested. Chitosan at 100 mug ml(-1) was lethal for most fungal human pathogens tested but non-toxic to HEK293 and COS7 mammalian cell lines. Besides, chitosan increased 90% survival of Galleria mellonella larvae infected with C. albicans. These results are of paramount for developing chitosan as antifungal.","['Candida spp.', 'Fusarium proliferatum', 'Mammalian cell lines', 'Membrane permeabilization', 'Nutrient limitation', 'ROS']",Fungal biology,Spain.

Neurospora crassaMicroTubule Binding protein-3 (MTB-3) is the homolog of yeast EB1, a highly conserved +TIP. To address the function of MTB-3, we examined strains with mtb-3 deletions, and we tagged MTB-3 with GFP to assess its dynamic behavior. MTB-3-GFP was present as comet-like structures distributed more or less homogeneously within the hyphal cytoplasm, and moving mainly towards the apex at speeds up to 4x faster than the normal hyphal elongation rates. MTB-3-GFP comets were present in all developmental stages, but were most abundant in mature hyphae. MTB-3-GFP comets were observed moving in anterograde and retrograde direction along the hypha. Retrograde movement was also observed as originating from the apical dome. The integrity of the microtubular cytoskeleton affects the presence and dynamics of MTB-3-GFP comets, while actin does not seem to play a role. The size of MTB-3-GFP comets is affected by the absence of dynactin and conventional kinesin. We detected no obvious morphological phenotypes in Deltamtb-3 mutants but there were fewer MTs in Deltamtb-3, MTs were less bundled and less organized. Compared to WT, both MT polymerization and depolymerization rates were significantly decreased in Deltamtb-3. In summary, the lack of MTB-3 affects overall growth and morphological phenotypes of N. crassa only slightly, but deletion of mtb-3 has strong effect on MT dynamics.",?,PloS one,Mexico. rmourino@cicese.mx,2013
27987187,Cations Optimization for Protein Enrichment in Rice Straw by Mixed Cultures of Neurospora crassa 14-8 and Candida utilis Using Response Surface Methodology.,"This study investigated the effect of cation optimization by mixed cultures of Neurospora crassa and Candida utilis on the true protein (TP) content. Firstly, to enhance the nutritional contents of rice straw (RS), two fermentation parameters (effect of inoculation ratio and inoculation time) were optimized. It was found that when C. utilis was inoculated 60 h later than N. crassa with the inoculation ratio of 1:5 (N. crassa to C. utilis), the maximum TP yield was obtained. In order to further optimize TP content, Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM) were adopted. The results of PBD indicated that Mn(2+), Zn(2+), and Cu(2+) were the significant variables. The optimum values for the three cations determined by the BBD were as follows: Mn(2+) 0.06 g/L, Zn(2+) 0.15 g/L, and Cu(2+) 0.2 g/L. After the optimization of RSM, a model was proposed to predict the optimum value 10.36% confirmed by the experimental result 9.84%. The TP content increased from 3.98 to 9.84%, with 147.24% of its increase rate.

24711369,The highly expressed methionine synthase gene of Neurospora crassa is positively regulated by its proximal heterochromatic region.,"In Neurospora crassa, the methionine synthase gene met-8 plays a key role in methionine synthesis. In this study, we found that MET-8 protein levels were compromised in several mutants defective in proper heterochromatin formation. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a 50-kb AT-rich region adjacent to the met-8 promoter. ChIP assays confirmed that trimethylated H3K9 was enriched in this region, indicating that heterochromatin may form upstream of met-8. In an H3K9R mutant strain, the output of met-8 was dramatically reduced, similar to what we observed in mutant strains that had defective heterochromatin formation. Furthermore, the production of ectopically expressed met-8 at the his-3 locus in the absence of a normal heterochromatin environment was inefficient, whereas ectopic expression of met-8 downstream of two other heterochromatin domains was efficient. In addition, our data show that the expression of mig-6 was also controlled by an upstream 4.2-kb AT-rich region similar to that of the met-8 gene, and we demonstrate that the AT-rich regions adjacent to met-8 or mig-6 are required for their peak expression. Our study indicates that met-8 and mig-6 may represent a novel type of gene, whose expression relies on the proper formation of a nearby heterochromatin region.",?,Nucleic acids research,China,2014 Jun
24879477,Interdependence of the actin and the microtubule cytoskeleton during fungal growth.,"Cell polarization is a theme in biology conserved from bacteria to man. One of the most extremely polarized cells in nature is the hyphae of filamentous fungi. A continuous flow of secretion vesicles from the hyphal cell body to the tip is essential for cell wall and membrane extension. Microtubules (MTs) and actin, along with their corresponding motor proteins, are involved in the secretion process. Therefore, the arrangement of the cytoskeleton is a crucial step to establish and maintain polarity. Here we review recent findings unraveling the mechanism of polarized growth with special emphasis on the role of the actin and MT cytoskeletons and cell end markers linking the two cytoskeletons.

26994287,The SEB-1 Transcription Factor Binds to the STRE Motif in Neurospora crassa and Regulates a Variety of Cellular Processes Including the Stress Response and Reserve Carbohydrate Metabolism.,"When exposed to stress conditions, all cells induce mechanisms resulting in an attempt to adapt to stress that involve proteins which, once activated, trigger cell responses by modulating specific signaling pathways. In this work, using a combination of pulldown assays and mass spectrometry analyses, we identified the Neurospora crassa SEB-1 transcription factor that binds to the Stress Response Element (STRE) under heat stress. Orthologs of SEB-1 have been functionally characterized in a few filamentous fungi as being involved in stress responses; however, the molecular mechanisms mediated by this transcription factor may not be conserved. Here, we provide evidences for the involvement of N. crassa SEB-1 in multiple cellular processes, including response to heat, as well as osmotic and oxidative stress. The Deltaseb-1 strain displayed reduced growth under these conditions, and genes encoding stress-responsive proteins were differentially regulated in the Deltaseb-1 strain grown under the same conditions. In addition, the SEB-1-GFP protein translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus under heat, osmotic, and oxidative stress conditions. SEB-1 also regulates the metabolism of the reserve carbohydrates glycogen and trehalose under heat stress, suggesting an interconnection between metabolism control and this environmental condition. We demonstrated that SEB-1 binds in vivo to the promoters of genes encoding glycogen metabolism enzymes and regulates their expression. A genome-wide transcriptional profile of the Deltaseb-1 strain under heat stress was determined by RNA-seq, and a broad range of cellular processes was identified that suggests a role for SEB-1 as a protein interconnecting these mechanisms.","['ChIP-qPCR', 'Neurospora crassa', 'RNA-seq', 'SEB-1', 'stress response']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Brazil,2016 May 3

We found that: 1) the diameter and growth rate of newly developing branches decreased as compared to intact mycelium (from 10-20 to 6.5 +/- 0.4 mum and from 24 +/- 1 to 6.7 +/- 0.5 mum/min, respectively), but the initial orientation of growth did not change; 2) the branching rhythm was altered; abnormally long internode distances appeared (up to 1471 mum), and the development of some side-branch buds ceased; 3) the character of the septation remained unchanged, as well as the hyphal segment length (68 +/- 2 mum). In hyphae growing for 4.5-5.0 h in isolation from the whole mycelium, the distance between the tip and the first septum was 210 +/- 15 mum, which was comparable with the respective value in intact mycelium, whereas the mean distance between the growth tip and the first side branch (492 +/-127 mum) and the dispersion of this parameter was considerably higher than in intact mycelium. In branches growing in isolation from the intact mycelium for 1.5-4.5 h, the length of the nucleus- free apical zones near the growth tip (from 5 to 33 mum) and the nucleus morphology were similar to the respective characteristics known for the N. crassa mycelium. The experimental model described here can be used for the investigations of molecular and genetic mechanisms regulating the interactions between intracellular structures involved in the tip growth of N. crassa.",?,Tsitologiia,,2016
23873861,Physiological role of Acyl coenzyme A synthetase homologs in lipid metabolism in Neurospora crassa.,"Acyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (ACS) enzymes catalyze the activation of free fatty acids (FAs) to CoA esters by a two-step thioesterification reaction. Activated FAs participate in a variety of anabolic and catabolic lipid metabolic pathways, including de novo complex lipid biosynthesis, FA beta-oxidation, and lipid membrane remodeling. Analysis of the genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa identified seven putative fatty ACSs (ACS-1 through ACS-7). ACS-3 was found to be the major activator for exogenous FAs for anabolic lipid metabolic pathways, and consistent with this finding, ACS-3 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and septa. Double-mutant analyses confirmed partial functional redundancy of ACS-2 and ACS-3. ACS-5 was determined to function in siderophore biosynthesis, indicating alternative functions for ACS enzymes in addition to fatty acid metabolism. The N. crassa ACSs involved in activation of FAs for catabolism were not specifically defined, presumably due to functional redundancy of several of ACSs for catabolism of exogenous FAs.",?,Eukaryotic cell,USA,2013 Sep
25384340,"Isolation, characterization and application of a cellulose-degrading strain Neurospora crassa S1 from oil palm empty fruit bunch.","BACKGROUND: Oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) is a lignocellulosic waste produced in palm oil industry. EFB mainly consists of cellulose, hemicellulose (mainly xylan) and lignin and has a great potential to be reused. Converting EFB to fermentable sugars and value-added chemicals is a much better choice than treating EFB as waste. RESULTS: A cellulase-producing strain growing on oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) was isolated and identified as Neurospora crassa S1, which is able to produce cellulases using EFB as the sole carbon source. The strain started to secret cellulases into the medium after 24 h of cultivation at 30 degrees C and reached its maximal cellulase activity at 240 h. Mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis showed that more than 50 proteins were secreted into the medium when EFB was used as the sole carbon source. Among them, 7 proteins were identified as putative enzymes associated with cellulose degradation. The whole cell culture of Neurospora crassa S1 was used to hydrolyze acid-treated EFB, giving a total sugar yield of 83.2%, which is comparable with that (82.0%) using a well-known cellulase producer Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30 (ATCC56765). CONCLUSION: Neurospora crassa S1 is a commercially promising native cellulase producer for EFB hydrolysis especially when the sugars obtained are to be fermented to products that require use of non-genetically engineered strains.",?,Microbial cell factories,Singapore. li_qingxin@ices.a-star.edu.sg,2014 Nov 11
25253091,A protein kinase screen of Neurospora crassa mutant strains reveals that the SNF1 protein kinase promotes glycogen synthase phosphorylation.,"Glycogen functions as a carbohydrate reserve in a variety of organisms and its metabolism is highly regulated. The activities of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, the rate-limiting enzymes of the synthesis and degradation processes, respectively, are regulated by allosteric modulation and reversible phosphorylation. To identify the protein kinases affecting glycogen metabolism in Neurospora crassa, we performed a screen of 84 serine/threonine kinase knockout strains. We identified multiple kinases that have already been described as controlling glycogen metabolism in different organisms, such as NcSNF1, NcPHO85, NcGSK3, NcPKA, PSK2 homologue and NcATG1. In addition, many hypothetical kinases have been implicated in the control of glycogen metabolism. Two kinases, NcIME-2 and NcNIMA, already functionally characterized but with no functions related to glycogen metabolism regulation, were also identified. Among the kinases identified, it is important to mention the role of NcSNF1. We showed in the present study that this kinase was implicated in glycogen synthase phosphorylation, as demonstrated by the higher levels of glycogen accumulated during growth, along with a higher glycogen synthase (GSN) +/-glucose 6-phosphate activity ratio and a lesser set of phosphorylated GSN isoforms in strain Ncsnf1KO, when compared with the wild-type strain. The results led us to conclude that, in N. crassa, this kinase promotes phosphorylation of glycogen synthase either directly or indirectly, which is the opposite of what is described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The kinases also play a role in gene expression regulation, in that gdn, the gene encoding the debranching enzyme, was down-regulated by the proteins identified in the screen. Some kinases affected growth and development, suggesting a connection linking glycogen metabolism with cell growth and development.",?,The Biochemical journal,Brazil,2014 Dec 15
25412208,HAM-5 functions as a MAP kinase scaffold during cell fusion in Neurospora crassa.,"Cell fusion in genetically identical Neurospora crassa germlings and in hyphae is a highly regulated process involving the activation of a conserved MAP kinase cascade that includes NRC-1, MEK-2 and MAK-2. During chemotrophic growth in germlings, the MAP kinase cascade members localize to conidial anastomosis tube (CAT) tips every  approximately 8 minutes, perfectly out of phase with another protein that is recruited to the tip: SOFT, a recently identified scaffold for the MAK-1 MAP kinase pathway in Sordaria macrospora. How the MAK-2 oscillation process is initiated, maintained and what proteins regulate the MAP kinase cascade is currently unclear. A global phosphoproteomics approach using an allele of mak-2 (mak-2Q100G) that can be specifically inhibited by the ATP analog 1NM-PP1 was utilized to identify MAK-2 kinase targets in germlings that were potentially involved in this process. One such putative target was HAM-5, a protein of unknown biochemical function. Previously, Deltaham-5 mutants were shown to be deficient for hyphal fusion. Here we show that HAM-5-GFP co-localized with NRC-1, MEK-2 and MAK-2 and oscillated with identical dynamics from the cytoplasm to CAT tips during chemotropic interactions. In the Deltamak-2 strain, HAM-5-GFP localized to punctate complexes that did not oscillate, but still localized to the germling tip, suggesting that MAK-2 activity influences HAM-5 function/localization. However, MAK-2-GFP showed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in a Deltaham-5 strain and did not localize to puncta. Via co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HAM-5 was shown to physically interact with NRC-1, MEK-2 and MAK-2, suggesting that it functions as a scaffold/transport hub for the MAP kinase cascade members for oscillation and chemotropic interactions during germling and hyphal fusion in N. crassa. The identification of HAM-5 as a scaffold-like protein will help to link the activation of MAK-2 cascade to upstream factors and proteins involved in this intriguing process of fungal communication.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2014 Nov
26541633,"Role of BGT-1 and BGT-2, two predicted GPI-anchored glycoside hydrolases/glycosyltransferases, in cell wall remodeling in Neurospora crassa.","Neurospora crassa BGT-1 (NCU06381) and BGT-2 (NCU09175) are two putative glycoside hydrolases (GHs) with additional predicted glycosyltransferase activity and binding sites for a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor that would facilitate their attachment to the plasma membrane (PM). To discern their role in key morphogenetic events during vegetative development of N. crassa, BGT-1 and BGT-2 were labeled with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The gfp was inserted immediately after the signal peptide sequence, within the bgt-1 encoding sequence, or directly before the GPI-binding site in the case of bgt-2. Both BGT-1-GFP and BGT-2-GFP were observed at the PM of the hyphal apical dome, excluding the foremost apical region and the Spitzenkorper (Spk), where chitin and beta-1,3-glucan synthases have been previously found. These and previous studies suggest a division of labor of the cell wall synthesizing machinery at the hyphal dome: at the very tip, glucans are synthesized by enzymes that accumulate at the Spk, before getting incorporated into the PM, whereas at the subtending zone below the apex, glucans are presumably hydrolyzed, producing amenable ends for further branching and crosslinking with other cell wall polymers. Additionally, BGT-1-GFP and BGT-2-GFP were observed at the leading edge of new developing septa, at unreleased interconidial junctions, at conidial poles, at germling and hyphal fusion sites, and at sites of branch emergence, all of them processes that seemingly involve cell wall remodeling. Even though single and double mutant strains for the corresponding genes did not show a drastic reduction of growth rate, bgt-2Delta and bgt-1Delta::bgt-2Delta strains exhibited an increased resistance to the cell wall stressors calcofluor white (CW) and congo red (CR) than the reference strain, which suggests they present significant architectural changes in their cell wall. Furthermore, the conidiation defects observed in the mutants indicate a significant role of BGT-1 and BGT-2 on the re-arrangement of glucans needed at the conidiophore cell wall to allow conidial separation.","['Cell wall remodeling', 'GFP tagging', 'Neurospora crassa', 'beta-1,3-Endoglucanases']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2015 Dec

Cullins form the scaffold of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and are modified by the covalent attachment of NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein that regulates the stability and activity of CRLs. We report that neddylation is not required for CUL4-dependent DNA methylation or heterochromatin formation but is required for the DNA repair functions. Moreover, the RING domain protein RBX1 and a segment of the CUL4 C terminus that normally interacts with RBX1, the E2 ligase, CAND1, and CSN are dispensable for DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation by DCDC.

28715960,Histone Methylation by SET Domain Proteins in Fungi.,"Histone-modifying enzymes are responsible for regulating transcription, recombination, DNA repair, DNA replication, chromatid cohesion, and chromosome segregation. Fungi are ideally suited for comparative chromatin biology because sequencing of numerous genomes from many clades is coupled to existing rich methodology that allows truly holistic approaches, integrating evolutionary biology with mechanistic molecular biology and ecology, promising applications in medicine or plant pathology. While genome information is rich, mechanistic studies on histone modifications are largely restricted to two yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and one filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa-three species that arguably are not representative of this diverse kingdom. Here, histone methylation serves as a paradigm to illustrate the roles chromatin modifications may play in more complex fungal life cycles. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of histone H3 methylation at two sites associated with active transcription, lysine 4 and lysine 36 (H3K4, H3K36); a site associated with the formation of constitutive heterochromatin, lysine 9 (H3K9); and a site associated with the formation of facultative heterochromatin, lysine 27 (H3K27).

28973881,Network of nutrient-sensing pathways and a conserved kinase cascade integrate osmolarity and carbon sensing in Neurospora crassa.,"Identifying nutrients available in the environment and utilizing them in the most efficient manner is a challenge common to all organisms. The model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates, from simple sugars to the complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls. The zinc binuclear cluster transcription factor CLR-1 is necessary for utilization of cellulose, a major, recalcitrant component of the plant cell wall; however, expression of clr-1 in the absence of an inducer is not sufficient to induce cellulase gene expression. We performed a screen for unidentified actors in the cellulose-response pathway and identified a gene encoding a hypothetical protein (clr-3) that is required for repression of CLR-1 activity in the absence of an inducer. Using clr-3 mutants, we implicated the hyperosmotic-response pathway in the tunable regulation of glycosyl hydrolase production in response to changes in osmolarity. The role of the hyperosmotic-response pathway in nutrient sensing may indicate that cells use osmolarity as a proxy for the presence of free sugar in their environment. These signaling pathways form a nutrient-sensing network that allows Ncrassa cells to tightly regulate gene expression in response to environmental conditions.","['MAP kinase cascade', 'carbon catabolite repression', 'carbon metabolism', 'hyperosmotic response', 'plant biomass degradation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CA 94720,2017 Oct 10
23685173,An apparent increase in meiotic silencing strength in crosses involving inbred Neurospora crassa strains.,"Meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA is a presumed RNAi-mediated elimination of the transcripts of any gene that is not properly paired with a homolog in meiosis. Wild-isolated strains of Neurospora crassa can be classified into three types based on the apparent strength of meiotic silencing of the bml (beta-tubulin) and mei-3 genes in crosses of the wild strains with the tester strains ::Bml(r) and ::mei-3. Crosses with ""OR"" and ""Sad"" type wild-isolates, respectively, did or did not silence both the genes, whereas crosses with the ""Esm"" type silenced bml, but not mei-3(+). Presumably, bml is more sensitive to silencing than mei-3, and silencing is strongest in crosses with the OR type, weakest (or non-evident) in crosses with the Sad type, and of intermediate strength in crosses with Esm type. Now, while constructing recombinant inbred lines from the Sad type wild strains Bichpuri-1 a and Spurger-3 A, we found that although crosses of Bichpuri-1 a and Spurger-3 A, and of most of their f1 progeny, with the ::Bml(r) and ::mei-3 testers were consistently and reproducibly Sad type, those of later generation strains of each line could show Sad, Esm, or a variably expressive Sad/Esm type. Since any genotype found in a later generation is, in principle, obtainable in the f1, the observed transition from an apparently stable Sad phenotype to an apparently unstable Sad/Esm phenotype appears not to be due to genotype differences between the generations. Therefore, the Sad versus Esm difference may have a genotype-independent basis.",?,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,India,2013 Jul
25596036,Dissecting the function of the different chitin synthases in vegetative growth and sexual development in Neurospora crassa.,"Chitin, one of the most important carbohydrates of the fungal cell wall, is synthesized by chitin synthases (CHS). Seven sequences encoding CHSs have been identified in the genome of Neurospora crassa. Previously, CHS-1, -3 and -6 were found at the Spitzenkorper(Spk) core and developing septa. We investigated the functional importance of each CHS in growth and development of N. crassa. The cellular distribution of each CHS tagged with fluorescent proteins and the impact of corresponding gene deletions on vegetative growth and sexual development were compared. CHS-2, -4, -5 and -7 were also found at the core of the Spk and in forming septa in vegetative hyphae. As the septum ring developed, CHS-2-GFP remained at the growing edge of the septum until it localized around the septal pore. In addition, all CHSs were located in cross-walls of conidiophores. A partial co-localization of CHS-1-m and CHS-5-GFP or CHS-2-GFP occurred in the Spk and septa. Analyses of deletion mutants suggested that CHS-6 has a role primarily in hyphal extension and ascospore formation, CHS-5 in aerial hyphae, conidia and ascospore formation, CHS-3 in perithecia development and CHS-7 in all of the aforementioned. We show that chs-7/csmB fulfills a sexual function and chs-6/chsG fulfills a vegetative growth function in N. crassa but not in Aspergillus nidulans, whereas vice versa chs-2/chsA fulfills a sexual function in A. nidulans but not in N. crassa. This suggests that different classes of CHSs can fulfill distinct developmental functions in various fungi. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry of CHS-1-GFP, CHS-4-GFP and CHS-5-GFP identified distinct putative interacting proteins for each CHS. Collectively, our results suggest that there are distinct populations of chitosomes, each carrying specific CHSs, with particular roles during different developmental stages.","['Cell wall', 'Chitin synthase', 'Hyphal morphogenesis', 'Proteomics', 'Sexual development', 'Spitzenkorper']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2015 Feb
28838355,Sixteen Years of Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa possesses a process called meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). MSUD has a remarkable ability to scan homologous chromosomes for unpaired DNA during meiosis. After unpaired DNA is identified, MSUD silences all RNA from the unpaired DNA along with any RNA transcribed from homologous sequences at other locations in the genome, regardless of their pairing state. The mechanism by which unpaired DNA is detected is unknown. Unpaired DNA segments can be as short as 1.3kb, if not shorter, and DNA sequences with only a small level of polymorphism (6%) can be considered unpaired by MSUD. MSUD research has identified nine proteins required for full efficiency of the process, three of which are homologs of the canonical RNA interference (RNAi) proteins Dicer, Argonaute, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Most MSUD proteins, including the RNAi homologs, appear to dock outside of the nuclear envelope during early stages of meiosis. Only two have been observed inside the nucleus, a low number given that the identification of unpaired DNA and the triggering of silencing must begin within this location. These two proteins may participate in the unpaired DNA detection process. Recent evidence indicates that the search for unpaired DNA is spatially constrained, possibly because of restrictions on the arrangement of chromatin loops during or after homolog pairing. This review attempts to provide a complete analysis of past, present, and future directions of MSUD research, starting with its discovery during a search for a conserved regulator of fungal development and ending with some benefits the process may provide to MSUD capable organisms.","['Chromosome', 'Epigenetics', 'Fungi', 'Gene', 'Homology search', 'Meiosis', 'Pairing', 'Silencing']",Advances in genetics,United States.

30216631,Interface interactions between betagamma-crystallin domain and Ig-like domain render Ca(2+) -binding site inoperative in abundant perithecial protein of Neurospora crassa.,"We describe a set of proteins in which a betagamma-crystallin domain pairs with an Ig-like domain, and which are confined to microbes, like bacteria, slime molds and fungi. DdCAD-1 (Ca(2+) -dependent cell adhesion molecule-1) and abundant perithecial protein (APP) represent this class of molecules. Using the crystal structure of APP-NTD (N-terminal domain of APP), we describe its mode of Ca(2+) binding and provide a generalized theme for correct identification of the Ca(2+) -binding site within this class of molecules. As a common feature, one of the two Ca(2+) -binding sites is non-functional in the betagamma-crystallin domains of these proteins. While APP-NTD binds Ca(2+) with a micromolar affinity which is comparable to DdCAD-1, APP surprisingly does not bind Ca(2+) . Crystal structures of APP and Ca(2+) -bound APP-NTD reveal that the interface interactions in APP render its Ca(2+) -binding site inoperative. Thus, heterodomain association provides a novel mode of Ca(2+) -binding regulation in APP. Breaking the interface interactions (mutating Asp30Ala, Leu132Ala and Ile135Ala) or separation from the Ig-like domain removes the constraints upon the required conformational transition and enables the betagamma-crystallin domain to bind Ca(2+) . In mechanistic detail, our work demonstrates an interdomain interface adapted to distinct functional niches in APP and its homolog DdCAD-1.",?,Molecular microbiology,India,2018 Dec
27986792,Alternative Oxidase Transcription Factors AOD2 and AOD5 of Neurospora crassa Control the Expression of Genes Involved in Energy Production and Metabolism.,"In Neurospora crassa, blocking the function of the standard mitochondrial electron transport chain results in the induction of an alternative oxidase (AOX). AOX transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to molecular oxygen. AOX serves as a model of retrograde regulation since it is encoded by a nuclear gene that is regulated in response to signals from mitochondria. The N. crassa transcription factors AOD2 and AOD5 are necessary for the expression of the AOX gene. To gain insight into the mechanism by which these factors function, and to determine if they have roles in the expression of additional genes in N. crassa, we constructed strains expressing only tagged versions of the proteins. Cell fractionation experiments showed that both proteins are localized to the nucleus under both AOX inducing and noninducing conditions. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis revealed that the proteins are bound to the promoter region of the AOX gene under both conditions. ChIP-seq also showed that the transcription factors bind to the upstream regions of a number of genes that are involved in energy production and metabolism. Dependence on AOD2 and AOD5 for the expression of several of these genes was verified by quantitative PCR. The majority of ChIP-seq peaks observed were enriched for both AOD2 and AOD5. However, we also observed occasional sites where one factor appeared to bind preferentially. The most striking of these was a conserved sequence that bound large amounts of AOD2 but little AOD5. This sequence was found within a 310 bp repeat unit that occurs at several locations in the genome.","['AOD2', 'AOD5', 'ChIP-seq', 'alternative oxidase', 'retrograde signaling']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Canada,2017 Feb 9
28107376,Deletion of pH Regulator pac-3 Affects Cellulase and Xylanase Activity during Sugarcane Bagasse Degradation by Neurospora crassa.,"Microorganisms play a vital role in bioethanol production whose usage as fuel energy is increasing worldwide. The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa synthesize and secrete the major enzymes involved in plant cell wall deconstruction. The production of cellulases and hemicellulases is known to be affected by the environmental pH; however, the regulatory mechanisms of this process are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of the pH regulator PAC-3 in N. crassa during their growth on sugarcane bagasse at different pH conditions. Our data indicate that secretion of cellulolytic enzymes is reduced in the mutant Deltapac-3 at alkaline pH, whereas xylanases are positively regulated by PAC-3 in acidic (pH 5.0), neutral (pH 7.0), and alkaline (pH 10.0) medium. Gene expression profiles, evaluated by real-time qPCR, revealed that genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases are also subject to PAC-3 control. Moreover, deletion of pac-3 affects the expression of transcription factor-encoding genes. Together, the results suggest that the regulation of holocellulase genes by PAC-3 can occur as directly as in indirect manner. Our study helps improve the understanding of holocellulolytic performance in response to PAC-3 and should thereby contribute to the better use of N. crassa in the biotechnology industry.",?,PloS one,Brazil,2017
23624246,"The bacterial secondary metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol impairs mitochondrial function and affects calcium homeostasis in Neurospora crassa.","The bacterial secondary metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) is of interest as an active ingredient of biological control strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens and as a potential lead pharmaceutical molecule because of its capacity to inhibit growth of diverse microbial and non-microbial cells. The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown and in this study the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa was used as a model to investigate the effects of DAPG on a eukaryotic cell. Colony growth, conidial germination and cell fusion assays confirmed the inhibitory nature of DAPG towards N. crassa. A number of different fluorescent dyes and fluorescent protein reporters were used to assess the effects of DAPG treatment on mitochondrial and other cellular functions. DAPG treatment led to changes in mitochondrial morphology, and rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. These effects are likely to be responsible for the toxicity of DAPG. It was also found that DAPG treatment caused extracellular calcium to be taken up by conidial germlings leading to a transient increase in cytosolic free Ca(2+) with a distinct concentration dependent Ca(2+) signature.",?,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Ireland,2013 Jul
28485098,Production of a fungal furocoumarin by a polyketide synthase gene cluster confers the chemo-resistance of Neurospora crassa to the predation by fungivorous arthropods.,"The formation of sexual fruiting bodies and production of polyketides are believed to be the most important strategies for fungal survival in environmental insults. In Neurospora crassa, the backbone gene of polyketide synthase gene cluster 6 (pks-6), which is expressed at lower level under vegetative growth, is highly expressed during perithecia development. Intriguingly, deletion of pks-6 does not affect perithecia maturation. How the expression of pks-6 correlates with fungal sexual development remains to be established. Here, we showed that overexpression of pks-6 results in an enhanced production of an insecticidal furocoumarin (neurosporin A). Deletion of pks-6, however, abolished neurosporin A biosynthesis. Moreover, the content of neurosporin A negatively associates with the food preference of fungivores, where the pks-6 knockout strain is more prone to be grazed by collembolans Sinella curviseta. Additionally, during vegetative growth, confrontation with Drosophila melanogaster also results in an enhanced expression of pks-6 and production of neurosporin A. Thus, high expression of pks-6 positively interrelates with the chemo-resistance of N. crassa to arthropod predation. Our findings suggest that pks-6 confers the production of insecticidal neurosporin A counteracting the feeding attack by arthropods during sexual development of N. crassa.",?,Environmental microbiology,China,2017 Oct
24224966,A comparative systems analysis of polysaccharide-elicited responses in Neurospora crassa reveals carbon source-specific cellular adaptations.,"Filamentous fungi are powerful producers of hydrolytic enzymes for the deconstruction of plant cell wall polysaccharides. However, the central question of how these sugars are perceived in the context of the complex cell wall matrix remains largely elusive. To address this question in a systematic fashion we performed an extensive comparative systems analysis of how the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa responds to the three main cell wall polysaccharides: pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose. We found the pectic response to be largely independent of the cellulolytic one with some overlap to hemicellulose, and in its extent surprisingly high, suggesting advantages for the fungus beyond being a mere carbon source. Our approach furthermore allowed us to identify carbon source-specific adaptations, such as the induction of the unfolded protein response on cellulose, and a commonly induced set of 29 genes likely involved in carbon scouting. Moreover, by hierarchical clustering we generated a coexpression matrix useful for the discovery of new components involved in polysaccharide utilization. This is exemplified by the identification of lat-1, which we demonstrate to encode for the physiologically relevant arabinose transporter in Neurospora. The analyses presented here are an important step towards understanding fungal degradation processes of complex biomass.",?,Molecular microbiology,USA,2014 Jan
24022114,Coexistence and expression profiles of two alternative splice variants of the pheromone receptor gene preâ€‘1 in Neurospora crassa.,"In this study, we show that two splice variants of the pheromone receptor gene (pre-1) transcript coexist in vegetative and reproductive tissues of the filamentous ascomycete fungus Neurospora crassa. The two splice variants differ by intron retention of the last intron, which is predicted to result in a premature stop codon and loss of 322 amino acids in the C-terminal cytosolic region of PRE-1. Using quantitative PCR, we show that expression of the variants is influenced by mating type (mat), with a higher proportion of intron-spliced transcripts in a mat A strain and a higher proportion of the intron-retained variant in a mat a strain. The intron-retained PRE-1 variant is predicted to lack 6 ubiquitination sites that may influence receptor function. In conclusion, N. crassa produce two pre-1 splice variants that display different transcription profiles.",?,Archives of microbiology,,2013 Nov
23766336,Analysis of a conserved cellulase transcriptional regulator reveals inducer-independent production of cellulolytic enzymes in Neurospora crassa.,"Cellulose is recalcitrant to deconstruction to glucose for use in fermentation strategies for biofuels and chemicals derived from lignocellulose. In Neurospora crassa, the transcriptional regulator, CLR-2, is required for cellulolytic gene expression and cellulose deconstruction. To assess conservation and divergence of cellulase gene regulation between fungi from different ecological niches, we compared clr-2 function with its ortholog (clrB) in the distantly related species, Aspergillus nidulans. Transcriptional profiles induced by exposure to crystalline cellulose were similar in both species. Approximately 50% of the cellulose-responsive genes showed strict dependence on functional clr-2/clrB, with a subset of 28 genes encoding plant biomass degrading enzymes that were conserved between N. crassa and A. nidulans. Importantly, misexpression of clr-2 under noninducing conditions was sufficient to drive cellulase gene expression, secretion, and activity in N. crassa, to a level comparable to wild type exposed to Avicel. However, misexpression of clrB in A. nidulans was not sufficient to drive cellulase gene expression under noninducing conditions, although an increase in cellulase activity was observed under crystalline cellulose conditions. Manipulation of clr-2 orthologs among filamentous fungi may enable regulated cellulosic enzyme production in a wide array of culture conditions and host strains, potentially reducing costs associated with enzyme production for plant cell wall deconstruction. However, this functionality may require additional engineering in some species.","['Aspergillus', 'Neurospora', 'biofuels', 'cellulase', 'transcriptional regulation']",MicrobiologyOpen,94720-3102,2013 Aug

The enzyme glucuronoyl esterase (GE) that constitutes a novel family of carbohydrate esterases, CE15, has been shown to display a unique ability to cleave the ester linkage between lignin alcohols and xylan-bound 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid of hemicellulose. We herein report identification, expression, and functional characterization of a new GE, NcGE, from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. C-terminally c-myc and hexahistidine-tagged NcGE was heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. NcGE purified from the culture supernatant through Ni-NTA and anion exchange chromatographies showed the ability to hydrolyze the substrate 3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propyl methyl 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosiduronate, which mimics the ester linkage of 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs). This esterase showed the characteristic of a mesophilic enzyme with the temperature optimum at 40-50 degrees C, and displayed the optimal activity at pH 7 and broad pH stability. Based on the alignment of NcGE with other GEs so far characterized, we propose novel consensus sequences for GEs containing the catalytic triad.",?,The Journal of general and applied microbiology,The University of Tokyo,2016 Nov 25
23809652,Transcriptomic profiling-based mutant screen reveals three new transcription factors mediating menadione resistance in Neurospora crassa.,"To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms of oxidative stress responses in filamentous fungi, the genome-wide transcriptional response of Neurospora crassa to menadione was analysed by digital gene expression (DGE) profiling, which identified 779 upregulated genes and 576 downregulated genes. Knockout mutants affecting 130 highly-upregulated genes were tested for menadione sensitivity, which revealed that loss of the transcription factor siderophore regulation (SRE) (a transcriptional repressor for siderophore biosynthesis), catatase-3, cytochrome c peroxidase or superoxide dismutase 1 copper chaperone causes hypersensitivity to menadione. Deletion of sre dramatically increased transcription of the siderophore biosynthesis gene ono and the siderophore iron transporter gene sit during menadione stress, suggesting that SRE is required for repression of iron uptake under oxidative stress conditions. Contrary to its phenotype, the sre deletion mutant showed higher transcriptional levels of genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers than wild type during menadione stress, which implies that the mutant suffers a higher level of oxidative stress than wild type. Uncontrolled iron uptake in the sre mutant might exacerbate cellular oxidative stress. This is the first report of a negative regulator of iron assimilation participating in the fungal oxidative stress response. In addition to SRE, eight other transcription factor genes were also menadione-responsive but their single gene knockout mutants showed wild-type menadione sensitivity. Two of them, named as mit-2 (menadione induced transcription factor-2) and mit-4 (menadione induced transcription factor-4), were selected for double mutant analysis. The double mutant was hypersensitive to menadione. Similarly, the double mutation of mit-2 and sre also had additive effects on menadione sensitivity, suggesting multiple transcription factors mediate oxidative stress resistance in an additive manner.",?,Fungal biology,China,2013 Jun
25474155,Selection and evaluation of reference genes for expression studies with quantitative PCR in the model fungus Neurospora crassa under different environmental conditions in continuous culture.,"Neurospora crassa has served as a model organism for studying circadian pathways and more recently has gained attention in the biofuel industry due to its enhanced capacity for cellulase production. However, in order to optimize N. crassa for biotechnological applications, metabolic pathways during growth under different environmental conditions must be addressed. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a technique that provides a high-throughput platform from which to measure the expression of a large set of genes over time. The selection of a suitable reference gene is critical for gene expression studies using relative quantification, as this strategy is based on normalization of target gene expression to a reference gene whose expression is stable under the experimental conditions. This study evaluated twelve candidate reference genes for use with N. crassa when grown in continuous culture bioreactors under different light and temperature conditions. Based on combined stability values from NormFinder and Best Keeper software packages, the following are the most appropriate reference genes under conditions of: (1) light/dark cycling: btl, asl, and vma1; (2) all-dark growth: btl, tbp, vma1, and vma2; (3) temperature flux: btl, vma1, act, and asl; (4) all conditions combined: vma1, vma2, tbp, and btl. Since N. crassa exists as different cell types (uni- or multi-nucleated), expression changes in a subset of the candidate genes was further assessed using absolute quantification. A strong negative correlation was found to exist between ratio and threshold cycle (CT) values, demonstrating that CT changes serve as a reliable reflection of transcript, and not gene copy number, fluctuations. The results of this study identified genes that are appropriate for use as reference genes in RT-qPCR studies with N. crassa and demonstrated that even with the presence of different cell types, relative quantification is an acceptable method for measuring gene expression changes during growth in bioreactors.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2014
26115753,Epigenetics as an emerging tool for improvement of fungal strains used in biotechnology.,"Filamentous fungi are today a major source of industrial biotechnology for the production of primary and secondary metabolites, as well as enzymes and recombinant proteins. All of them have undergone extensive improvement strain programs, initially by classical mutagenesis and later on by genetic manipulation. Thereby, strategies to overcome rate-limiting or yield-reducing reactions included manipulating the expression of individual genes, their regulatory genes, and also their function. Yet, research of the last decade clearly showed that cells can also undergo heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequences (=epigenetics). This involves three levels of regulation: (i) DNA methylation, (ii) chromatin remodeling by histone modification, and (iii) RNA interference. The demonstration of the occurrence of these processes in fungal model organisms such as Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa has stimulated its recent investigation as a tool for strain improvement in industrially used fungi.

24673848,"Identification and characterization of LFD1, a novel protein involved in membrane merger during cell fusion in Neurospora crassa.","Despite its essential role in development, molecular mechanisms of membrane merger during cell-cell fusion in most eukaryotic organisms remain elusive. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, cell fusion occurs during asexual spore germination, where genetically identical germlings show chemotropic interactions and cell-cell fusion. Fusion of germlings and hyphae is required for the formation of the interconnected mycelial network characteristic of filamentous fungi. Previously, a multipass membrane protein, PRM1, was characterized and acts at the step of bilayer fusion in N. crassa. Here we describe the identification and characterization of lfd-1, encoding a single pass transmembrane protein, which is also involved in membrane merger. lfd-1 was identified by a targeted analysis of a transcriptional profile of a transcription factor mutant (Deltapp-1) defective in germling fusion. The Deltalfd-1 mutant shows a similar, but less severe, membrane merger defect as a DeltaPrm1 mutant. By genetic analyses, we show that LFD1 and PRM1 act independently, but share a redundant function. The cell fusion frequency of both Deltalfd-1 and DeltaPrm1 mutants was sensitive to extracellular calcium concentration and was associated with an increase in cell lysis, which was suppressed by a calcium-dependent mechanism involving a homologue to synaptotagmin.",?,Molecular microbiology,USA,2014 Apr

Its mycobacterial biosynthetic pathway has five steps (EgtA-E catalysis) with two novel reactions: a mononuclear nonheme iron enzyme (EgtB) catalyzed oxidative C-S bond formation and a PLP-mediated C-S lyase (EgtE) reaction. Our bioinformatic and biochemical analyses indicate that the fungus Neurospora crassa has a more concise ergothioneine biosynthetic pathway because its nonheme iron enzyme, Egt1, makes use of cysteine instead of gamma-Glu-Cys as the substrate. Such a change of substrate preference eliminates the competition between ergothioneine and glutathione biosyntheses. In addition, we have identified the N. crassa C-S lyase (NCU11365) and reconstituted its activity in vitro, which makes the future ergothioneine production through metabolic engineering feasible.",?,Organic letters,P.

Analysis of septin null mutants demonstrated that septins limit the sites of emergence of germ tubes and are important for septation and conidiation in N. crassa. Septins constituted a range of different higher-order structures in N. crassa - rings, loops, fibres, bands, and caps - which can co-exist within the same cell. They showed different patterns of localisation at germ tube tips, with GFP-CDC-10 and CDC-11-GFP forming a subapical collar with lower signal intensity at the tip apex, CDC-3-GFP and CDC-12-GFP organized as a cap at the tip apex and GFP-ASP-1 forming an extended subapical collar.

29297465,Telomere repeats induce domains of H3K27 methylation in Neurospora.,"Development in higher organisms requires selective gene silencing, directed in part by di-/trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3). Knowledge of the cues that control formation of such repressive Polycomb domains is extremely limited. We exploited natural and engineered chromosomal rearrangements in the fungus Neurospora crassa to elucidate the control of H3K27me2/3. Analyses of H3K27me2/3 in strains bearing chromosomal rearrangements revealed both position-dependent and position-independent facultative heterochromatin. We found that proximity to chromosome ends is necessary to maintain, and sufficient to induce, transcriptionally repressive, subtelomeric H3K27me2/3. We ascertained that such telomere-proximal facultative heterochromatin requires native telomere repeats and found that a short array of ectopic telomere repeats, (TTAGGG)(17,) can induce a large domain (~225 kb) of H3K27me2/3. This provides an example of a cis-acting sequence that directs H3K27 methylation.

Each defensin has a hallmark gamma-core motif (GXCX(3-9) C), which contains major determinants of its antifungal activity. In this study, the antifungal activities of MsDef1, MtDef4, and peptides derived from their gamma-core motifs, were characterized during colony initiation in the fungal model, Neurospora crassa. These defensins and their cognate peptides inhibited conidial germination and accompanying cell fusion with different potencies. The inhibitory effects of MsDef1 were strongly mediated by the plasma membrane localized sphingolipid glucosylceramide. Cell fusion was selectively inhibited by the hexapeptide RGFRRR derived from the gamma-core motif of MtDef4. Fluorescent labelling of this hexapeptide showed that it strongly bound to the germ tube plasma membrane/cell wall. Using N. crassa expressing the Ca(2+) reporter aequorin, MsDef1, MtDef4 and their cognate peptides were each shown to perturb Ca(2+) homeostasis in specific and distinct ways, and the disruptive effects of MsDef1 on Ca(2+) were mediated by glucosylceramide.

25595444,"Identification and characterization of LFD-2, a predicted fringe protein required for membrane integrity during cell fusion in neurospora crassa.","The molecular mechanisms of membrane merger during somatic cell fusion in eukaryotic species are poorly understood. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, somatic cell fusion occurs between genetically identical germinated asexual spores (germlings) and between hyphae to form the interconnected network characteristic of a filamentous fungal colony. In N. crassa, two proteins have been identified to function at the step of membrane fusion during somatic cell fusion: PRM1 and LFD-1. The absence of either one of these two proteins results in an increase of germling pairs arrested during cell fusion with tightly appressed plasma membranes and an increase in the frequency of cell lysis of adhered germlings. The level of cell lysis in DeltaPrm1 or Deltalfd-1 germlings is dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration. An available transcriptional profile data set was used to identify genes encoding predicted transmembrane proteins that showed reduced expression levels in germlings cultured in the absence of extracellular calcium. From these analyses, we identified a mutant (lfd-2, for late fusion defect-2) that showed a calcium-dependent cell lysis phenotype. lfd-2 encodes a protein with a Fringe domain and showed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane localization. The deletion of an additional gene predicted to encode a low-affinity calcium transporter, fig1, also resulted in a strain that showed a calcium-dependent cell lysis phenotype.

24717808,CZT-1 is a novel transcription factor controlling cell death and natural drug resistance in Neurospora crassa.,"We pinpoint CZT-1 (cell death-activated zinc cluster transcription factor) as a novel transcription factor involved in tolerance to cell death induced by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine in Neurospora crassa. Transcriptional profiling of staurosporine-treated wild-type cells by RNA-sequencing showed that genes encoding the machinery for protein synthesis are enriched among the genes repressed by the drug. Functional category enrichment analyses also show that genes encoding components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are downregulated by staurosporine, whereas genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum activities are upregulated. In contrast, a staurosporine-treated Deltaczt-1 deletion strain is unable to repress the genes for the respiratory chain and to induce the genes related to the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating a role for CZT-1 in the regulation of activity of these organelles. The Deltaczt-1 mutant strain displays increased reactive oxygen species accumulation on insult with staurosporine. A genome-wide association study of a wild population of N. crassa isolates pointed out genes associated with a cell death role of CZT-1, including catalase-1 (cat-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor-homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death 2 (amid-2). Importantly, differences in the expression of czt-1 correlates with resistance to staurosporine among wild isolate strains.

Major progress has been made in dissecting the molecular pathways that regulate DNA methylation. Yet, little is known about DNA methylation variation over evolutionary time. Here we present an investigation of the variation of DNA methylation and transposable element (TE) content in species of the filamentous ascomycetes Neurospora. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation data at single-base resolution, together with genomic TE content and gene expression data, of 10 individuals representing five closely related Neurospora species. We found that the methylation levels were low (ranging from 1.3% to 2.5%) and varied among the genomes in a species-specific way. Furthermore, we found that the TEs over 400 bp long were targeted by DNA methylation, and in all genomes, high methylation correlated with low GC, confirming a conserved link between DNA methylation and Repeat Induced Point (RIP) mutations in this group of fungi. Both TE content and DNA methylation pattern showed phylogenetic signal, and the species with the highest TE load (N. crassa) also exhibited the highest methylation level per TE.

Previous studies focused on characterizing the role of these transporters in only a few conditions, including cellulose degradation, and the function of these two transporters is not yet completely understood. In this study, we show that deletion of cdt-2, but not cdt-1, results in growth defects not only on Avicel but also on xylan. cdt-2 can be highly induced by xylan, and this mutant has a xylodextrin consumption defect. Transcriptomic analysis of the cdt-2 deletion strain on Avicel and xylan showed that major cellulase and hemicellulase genes were significantly down-regulated in the cdt-2 deletion strain and artificial over expression of cdt-2 in N. crassa increased cellulase and hemicellulase production. Together, these data clearly show that CDT-2 plays a critical role in hemicellulose sensing and utilization. This is the first time a sugar transporter has been assigned a function in the hemicellulose degradation pathway. Furthermore, we found that the transcription factor XLR-1 is the major regulator of cdt-2, while cdt-1 is primarily regulated by CLR-1.

Regulatory mechanisms that are controlled by CLR-2, ClrB, and ManR are also significantly different, although they are orthologous factors. Expression of clr-2 requires the activation of another transcription factor, CLR-1, by cellobiose, while CLR-2 is constitutively active for transactivation. By contrast, ClrB activation requires cellobiose. While ClrB mainly regulates cellulolytic genes, ManR is essential for the activation of not only cellulolytic but also mannanolytic enzyme genes. In this review, we summarize XlnR/Xyr1- and CLR-2/ClrB/ManR-dependent regulation in N. crassa, A. nidulans, A. oryzae, and T. reesei and emphasize the conservation and diversity of the regulatory systems for cellulolytic enzyme genes in these Ascomycete fungi. In addition, we discuss the role of McmA, another transcription factor that plays an important role in recruiting ClrB to the promoters in A. nidulans.","['CLR-2/ClrB/ManR', 'Cellulases', 'McmA', 'Transcription factor', 'XlnR/Xyr1']",Current genetics,Japan,2017 Dec
24870047,Experimental evolution of bet hedging under manipulated environmental uncertainty in Neurospora crassa.,"All organisms are faced with environmental uncertainty. Bet-hedging theory expects unpredictable selection to result in the evolution of traits that maximize the geometric-mean fitness even though such traits appear to be detrimental over the shorter term. Despite the centrality of fitness measures to evolutionary analysis, no direct test of the geometric-mean fitness principle exists. Here, we directly distinguish between predictions of competing fitness maximization principles by testing Cohen's 1966 classic bet-hedging model using the fungus Neurospora crassa. The simple prediction is that propagule dormancy will evolve in proportion to the frequency of 'bad' years, whereas the prediction of the alternative arithmetic-mean principle is the evolution of zero dormancy as long as the expectation of a bad year is less than 0.5. Ascospore dormancy fraction in N. crassa was allowed to evolve under five experimental selection regimes that differed in the frequency of unpredictable 'bad years'. Results were consistent with bet-hedging theory: final dormancy fraction in 12 genetic lineages across 88 independently evolving samples was proportional to the frequency of bad years, and evolved both upwards and downwards as predicted from a range of starting dormancy fractions. These findings suggest that selection results in adaptation to variable rather than to expected environments.","['bet hedging', 'dormancy', 'geometric-mean fitness', 'life-history evolution', 'spore germination', 'stochasticity']",Proceedings.

23729384,The plasma membrane proton pump PMA-1 is incorporated into distal parts of the hyphae independently of the Spitzenkorper in Neurospora crassa.,"Most models for fungal growth have proposed a directional traffic of secretory vesicles to the hyphal apex, where they temporarily aggregate at the Spitzenkorper before they fuse with the plasma membrane (PM). The PM H(+)-translocating ATPase (PMA-1) is delivered via the classical secretory pathway (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] to Golgi) to the cell surface, where it pumps H(+) out of the cell, generating a large electrochemical gradient that supplies energy to H(+)-coupled nutrient uptake systems. To characterize the traffic and delivery of PMA-1 during hyphal elongation, we have analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) strains of Neurospora crassa expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of the protein. In conidia, PMA-1-GFP was evenly distributed at the PM. During germination and germ tube elongation, PMA-1-GFP was found all around the conidial PM and extended to the germ tube PM, but fluorescence was less intense or almost absent at the tip. Together, the data indicate that the electrochemical gradient driving apical nutrient uptake is generated from early developmental stages. In mature hyphae, PMA-1-GFP localized at the PM at distal regions (>120 mum) and in completely developed septa, but not at the tip, indicative of a distinct secretory route independent of the Spitzenkorper occurring behind the apex.",?,Eukaryotic cell,Mexico,2013 Aug

The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is an excellent model for the complex molecular network of regulatory mechanisms that are common to all eukaryotes. At the heart of the network, posttranslational regulation and functions of the core clock elements are of major interest.

36165613,Male fertility in Pyricularia oryzae: Microconidia are spermatia.,"Sexual reproduction in Ascomycetes is well described in several model organisms such as Neurospora crassa or Podospora anserina. Deciphering the biological process of sexual reproduction (from the recognition between compatible partners to the formation of zygote) can be a major advantage to better control sexually reproducing pathogenic fungi. In Pyricularia oryzae, the fungal pathogen causing blast diseases on several Poaceae species, the biology of sexual reproduction remains poorly documented. Besides the well-documented production of asexual macroconidia, the production of microconidia was seldom reported in P. oryzae, and their role as male gamete (i.e., spermatia) and in male fertility has never been explored. Here, we characterised the morphological features of microconidia and demonstrated that they are bona fide spermatia. Contrary to macroconidia, microconidia are not able to germinate and seem to be the only male gametes in P. oryzae. We show that fruiting body (perithecium) formation requires microconidia to get in contact with mycelium of strains of opposite mating type, to presumably fertilise the female gametes.",?,Environmental microbiology,France,2022 Dec
32393638,Evolutionarily ancient BAH-PHD protein mediates Polycomb silencing.,"Methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) is widely recognized as a transcriptionally repressive chromatin modification but the mechanism of repression remains unclear. We devised and implemented a forward genetic scheme to identify factors required for H3K27 methylation-mediated silencing in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa and identified a bromo-adjacent homology (BAH)-plant homeodomain (PHD)-containing protein, EPR-1 (effector of polycomb repression 1; NCU07505). EPR-1 associates with H3K27-methylated chromatin, and loss of EPR-1 de-represses H3K27-methylated genes without loss of H3K27 methylation. EPR-1 is not fungal-specific; orthologs of EPR-1 are present in a diverse array of eukaryotic lineages, suggesting an ancestral EPR-1 was a component of a primitive Polycomb repression pathway.","['H3K27 methylation', 'Polycomb repressive complex', 'epigenetics', 'facultative heterochromatin', 'histone reader']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,OR 97403,2020 May 26

The genome of the filamentous fungus and model organism Neurospora crassa encodes catalytic subunits for 30 protein phosphatase genes. In this study, we have characterized 24 viable N. crassa phosphatase catalytic subunit knockout mutants for phenotypes during growth, asexual development, and sexual development. We found that 91% of the mutants had defects in at least one of these traits, whereas 29% possessed phenotypes in all three. Chemical sensitivity screens were conducted to reveal additional phenotypes for the mutants. This resulted in the identification of at least one chemical sensitivity phenotype for 17 phosphatase knockout mutants, including novel chemical sensitivities for two phosphatase mutants lacking a growth or developmental phenotype. Hence, chemical sensitivity or growth/developmental phenotype was observed for all 24 viable mutants. We investigated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation profiles in the phosphatase mutants and identified nine potential candidates for regulators of the p38 MAPK. We demonstrated that the PP2C class phosphatase pph-8 (NCU04600) is an important regulator of female sexual development in N. crassa. In addition, we showed that the Deltacsp-6 (DeltaNCU08380) mutant exhibits a phenotype similar to the previously identified conidial separation mutants, Deltacsp-1 and Deltacsp-2, that lack transcription factors important for regulation of conidiation and the circadian clock.","['filamentous fungi', 'functional genomics', 'protein phosphorylation', 'serine-threonine protein phosphatases', 'tyrosine protein phosphatases']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",California 92521,2014 Feb 19
24130891,SERS properties of different sized and shaped gold nanoparticles biosynthesized under different environmental conditions by Neurospora crassa extract.,"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a surface-sensitive technique that enhances Raman scattering by molecules adsorbed on rough metal surfaces. It is known that metal nanoparticles, especially gold and silver nanoparticles, exhibit great SERS properties, which make them very attractive for the development of biosensors and biocatalysts. On the other hand, the development of ecofriendly methods for the synthesis of metallic nanostructures has become the focus of research in several countries, and many microorganisms and plants have already been used to biosynthesize metallic nanostructures. However, the majority of these are pathogenic to plants or humans. Here, we report gold nanoparticles with good SERS properties, biosynthesized by Neurospora crassa extract under different environmental conditions, increasing Raman signals up to 40 times using methylene blue as a target molecule. Incubation of tetrachloroauric acid solution with the fungal extract at 60 degrees C and a pH value of a) 3, b) 5.5, and c) 10 resulted in the formation of gold nanoparticles of a) different shapes like triangles, hexagons, pentagons etc. in a broad size range of about 10-200 nm, b) mostly quasi-spheres with some different shapes in a main size range of 6-23 nm, and c) only quasi-spheres of 3-12 nm.

25144221,"VIB1, a link between glucose signaling and carbon catabolite repression, is essential for plant cell wall degradation by Neurospora crassa.","Filamentous fungi that thrive on plant biomass are the major producers of hydrolytic enzymes used to decompose lignocellulose for biofuel production. Although induction of cellulases is regulated at the transcriptional level, how filamentous fungi sense and signal carbon-limited conditions to coordinate cell metabolism and regulate cellulolytic enzyme production is not well characterized. By screening a transcription factor deletion set in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa for mutants unable to grow on cellulosic materials, we identified a role for the transcription factor, VIB1, as essential for cellulose utilization. VIB1 does not directly regulate hydrolytic enzyme gene expression or function in cellulosic inducer signaling/processing, but affects the expression level of an essential regulator of hydrolytic enzyme genes, CLR2. Transcriptional profiling of a Deltavib-1 mutant suggests that it has an improper expression of genes functioning in metabolism and energy and a deregulation of carbon catabolite repression (CCR). By characterizing new genes, we demonstrate that the transcription factor, COL26, is critical for intracellular glucose sensing/metabolism and plays a role in CCR by negatively regulating cre-1 expression. Deletion of the major player in CCR, cre-1, or a deletion of col-26, did not rescue the growth of Deltavib-1 on cellulose. However, the synergistic effect of the Deltacre-1; Deltacol-26 mutations circumvented the requirement of VIB1 for cellulase gene expression, enzyme secretion and cellulose deconstruction. Our findings support a function of VIB1 in repressing both glucose signaling and CCR under carbon-limited conditions, thus enabling a proper cellular response for plant biomass deconstruction and utilization.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2014 Aug
27458122,Regulation of Neurospora Catalase-3 by global heterochromatin formation and its proximal heterochromatin region.,"Catalase-3 (CAT-3) constitutes the main catalase activity in growing hyphae of Neurospora crassa, and its activity increases during exponential growth or is induced under different stress conditions. Although extensive progress has been made to identify catalase regulators, the regulation mechanism of CAT-3 at the chromatin level still remains unclear. Here, we aim at investigating the molecular regulation mechanisms of cat-3 at the chromatin level. We found that CAT-3 protein levels increased in mutants defective in proper global heterochromatin formation. Bioinformatics analysis identified a 5-kb AT-rich sequence adjacent to the cat-3 promoter as a heterochromatin region because of its enrichment of H3K9me3 and HP1. Expression of CAT-3 was induced by H(2)O(2) treatment in wild-type and such change occurred along with the accumulation of histone H3 acetylation at 5-kb heterochromatin boundaries and cat-3 locus, but without alteration of its H3K9me3 repressive modification. Moreover, disruption of 5-kb heterochromatin region results in elevated cat-3 expression, and higher levels of cat-3 expression were promoted by the combination with global heterochromatin defective mutants. Interestingly, the molecular weight and activity bands of CAT-3 protein are different in heterochromatin defective mutants compared with those in wild-type, suggesting that its N-terminal processing and modification may be altered. Our study indicates that the local chromatin structure creates a heterochromatin repressive environment to repress nearby gene expression.","['Catalase-3', 'Heterochromatin', 'Hydrogen peroxide', 'Post-translational modification']",Free radical biology & medicine,China,2016 Oct

24243796,Global gene expression and focused knockout analysis reveals genes associated with fungal fruiting body development in Neurospora crassa.,"Fungi can serve as highly tractable models for understanding genetic basis of sexual development in multicellular organisms. Applying a reverse-genetic approach to advance such a model, we used random and multitargeted primers to assay gene expression across perithecial development in Neurospora crassa. We found that functionally unclassified proteins accounted for most upregulated genes, whereas downregulated genes were enriched for diverse functions. Moreover, genes associated with developmental traits exhibited stage-specific peaks of expression. Expression increased significantly across sexual development for mating type gene mat a-1 and for mat A-1 specific pheromone precursor ccg-4. In addition, expression of a gene encoding a protein similar to zinc finger, stc1, was highly upregulated early in perithecial development, and a strain with a knockout of this gene exhibited arrest at the same developmental stage. A similar expression pattern was observed for genes in RNA silencing and signaling pathways, and strains with knockouts of these genes were also arrested at stages of perithecial development that paralleled their peak in expression. The observed stage specificity allowed us to correlate expression upregulation and developmental progression and to identify regulators of sexual development. Bayesian networks inferred from our expression data revealed previously known and new putative interactions between RNA silencing genes and pathways. Overall, our analysis provides a fine-scale transcriptomic landscape and novel inferences regarding the control of the multistage development process of sexual crossing and fruiting body development in N. crassa.",?,Eukaryotic cell,USA,2014 Jan

33561578,Aggregation kinetics of the protein photoreceptor Vivid.,"The aggregation of proteins is of importance in fields ranging from protein homeostasis to disease. The light-sensing protein Vivid (VVD) regulates responses to blue-light illumination in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Consisting of a single lightâ€‘oxygen-voltage domain, VVD is characterized by cycling between dark and lit states that correspond to formation and disruption of a photoadduct between the flavin cofactor and the apoprotein. Recently, in vitro assays have shown that VVD undergoes self-oxidative damage and aggregation resulting from excessive blue-light illumination. To explore the aggregation process of VVD, here we study the kinetics of aggregation and how it is influenced by environmental factors such as initial protein concentration, temperature, and light. We found that the aggregation kinetics of VVD is consistent with a second-order reaction model involving kinetic control, where thermal decay from lit-VVD to dark-VVD is necessary for aggregation to proceed. The height of the energy barrier separating the lit and dark VVD states is measured as (80 +/- 2) kJ mol(-1). Application of the kinetic model to the observed dependence of aggregation vs. temperature allowed us to further estimate the energy involved in the nucleation of dark-VVD, (257 +/- 24) kJ mol(-1). Finally, we show that VVD aggregation levels increase as the time of blue light exposure is augmented, suggesting possible mechanisms for protein damage. These results demonstrate how aggregation of a photoreceptor depends not only on environmental factors but on the intrinsic response of the protein to illumination.","['Activation energy barrier', 'Kinetic control', 'Nucleation kinetics', 'Photoreceptor', 'Protein aggregation', 'Vivid']",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

24747913,Alteration of light-dependent gene regulation by the absence of the RCO-1/RCM-1 repressor complex in the fungus Neurospora crassa.,"The activation of transcription by light in the fungus Neurospora crassa requires the White Collar Complex (WCC), a photoreceptor and transcription factor complex. After light reception two WCCs interact and bind the promoters of light-regulated genes to activate transcription. This process is regulated by VVD, a small photoreceptor that disrupts the interaction between WCCs and leads to a reduction in transcription after long exposures to light. The N. crassa RCO-1/RCM-1 repressor complex is the homolog of the Tup1-Ssn6 repressor complex in yeast, and its absence modifies photoadaptation. We show that the absence of the RCO-1/RCM-1 repressor complex leads to several alterations in transcription that are gene-specific: an increase in the accumulation of mRNAs in the dark, a repression of transcription, and a derepression of transcription after long exposures to light. The absence of the RCO-1/RCM-1 repressor complex leads to lower VVD levels that are available for the regulation of the activity of the WCC. The reduction in the amount of VVD results in increased WCC binding to the promoters of light-regulated genes in the dark and after long exposures to light, leading to the modification of photoadaptation that has been observed in rco-1 and rcm-1 mutants. Our results show that the photoadaptation phenotype of mutants in the RCO-1/RCM-1 repressor complex is, at least in part, an indirect consequence of the reduction of vvd transcription, and the resulting modification in the regulation of transcription by the WCC.",?,PloS one,Spain,2014

34182774,FRQ-CK1 Interaction Underlies Temperature Compensation of the Neurospora Circadian Clock.,"Temperature compensation is a fundamental property of all circadian clocks; temperature compensation results in a relatively constant period length at different physiological temperatures, but its mechanism is unclear. Formation of a stable complex between clock proteins and casein kinase 1 (CK1) is a conserved feature in eukaryotic circadian mechanisms. Here, we show that the FRQ-CK1 interaction and CK1-mediated FRQ phosphorylation, not FRQ stability, are main mechanisms responsible for the circadian temperature compensation phenotypes in Neurospora. Inhibition of CK1 kinase activity impaired the temperature compensation profile. Importantly, both the loss of temperature compensation and temperature overcompensation phenotypes of the wild-type and different clock mutant strains can be explained by temperature-dependent alterations of the FRQ-CK1 interaction. Furthermore, mutations that were designed to specifically affect the FRQ-CK1 interaction resulted in impaired temperature compensation of the clock. Together, these results reveal the temperature-compensated FRQ-CK1 interaction, which results in temperature-compensated CK1-mediated FRQ and WC phosphorylation, as a main biochemical process that underlies the mechanism of circadian temperature compensation in Neurospora. IMPORTANCE Temperature compensation allows clocks to adapt to all seasons by having a relatively constant period length at different physiological temperatures, but the mechanism of temperature compensation is unclear. Stability of clock proteins was previously proposed to be a major factor that regulated temperature compensation. In this study, we showed that the interaction between CK1 and FRQ, but not FRQ stability, explains the circadian temperature compensation phenotypes in Neurospora. This study uncovered the key biochemical mechanism responsible for temperature compensation of the circadian clock and further established the mechanism for period length determination in Neurospora. Because the regulation of circadian clock proteins by CK1 and the formation of a stable clock complex with CK1 are highly conserved in eukaryotic clocks, a similar mechanism may also exist in animal clocks.","['Neurospora', 'casein kinase 1', 'circadian clock', 'protein phosphorylation', 'temperature compensation']",mBio,China,2021 Jun 29

Toward understanding how light and the circadian clock regulate gene expression, we used genome-wide approaches to identify the direct and indirect targets of the light-responsive and clock-controlled transcription factor ADV-1 in Neurospora crassa A large proportion of ADV-1 targets were found to be light- and/or clock-controlled, and enriched for genes involved in development, metabolism, cell growth, and cell fusion. We show that ADV-1 is necessary for transducing light and/or temporal information to its immediate downstream targets, including controlling rhythms in genes critical to somatic cell fusion. However, while ADV-1 targets are altered in predictable ways in Deltaadv-1 cells in response to light, this is not always the case for rhythmic target gene expression. These data suggest that a complex regulatory network downstream of ADV-1 functions to generate distinct temporal dynamics of target gene expression relative to the central clock mechanism.","['circadian clock', 'development', 'phototransduction', 'regulatory network']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Texas 77843,2017 Jan 5
33825541,Shared Components of the FRQ-Less Oscillator and TOR Pathway Maintain Rhythmicity in Neurospora.,"Molecular models for the endogenous oscillators that drive circadian rhythms in eukaryotes center on rhythmic transcription/translation of a small number of ""clock genes."" Although substantial evidence supports the concept that negative and positive transcription/translation feedback loops (TTFLs) are responsible for regulating the expression of these clock genes, certain rhythms in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa continue even when clock genes (frq, wc-1, and wc-2) are not rhythmically expressed. Identification of the rhythmic processes operating outside of the TTFL has been a major unresolved area in circadian biology. Our lab previously identified a mutation (vta) that abolishes FRQ-less rhythmicity of the conidiation rhythm and also affects rhythmicity when FRQ is functional. Further studies identified the vta gene product as a component of the TOR (Target of Rapamycin) nutrient-sensing pathway that is conserved in eukaryotes. We now report the discovery of TOR pathway components including GTR2 (homologous to the yeast protein Gtr2, and RAG C/D in mammals) as binding partners of VTA through co-immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry analysis using a VTA-FLAG strain. Reciprocal IP with GTR2-FLAG found VTA as a binding partner. A Deltagtr2 strain was deficient in growth responses to amino acids. Free-running conidiation rhythms in a FRQ-less strain were abolished in Deltagtr2. Entrainment of a FRQ-less strain to cycles of heat pulses demonstrated that Deltagtr2 is defective in entrainment. In all of these assays, Deltagtr2 is similar to Deltavta. In addition, expression of GTR2 protein was found to be rhythmic across two circadian cycles, and functional VTA was required for GTR2 rhythmicity. FRQ protein exhibited the expected rhythm in the presence of GTR2 but the rhythmic level of FRQ dampened in the absence of GTR2. These results establish association of VTA with GTR2, and their role in maintaining functional circadian rhythms through the TOR pathway.","['FRQ', 'FRQ-less oscillator', 'Ragulator', 'TOR pathway', 'circadian rhythm']",Journal of biological rhythms,Canada,2021 Aug
30139524,Modeling Reveals a Key Mechanism for Light-Dependent Phase Shifts of Neurospora Circadian Rhythms.,"Light shifts and synchronizes the phase of the circadian clock to daily environments, which is critical for maintaining the daily activities of an organism. It has been proposed that such light-dependent phase shifts are triggered by light-induced upregulation of a negative element of the core circadian clock (i.e., frq, Per1/2) in many organisms, including fungi. However, we find, using systematic mathematical modeling of the Neurospora crassa circadian clock, that the upregulation of the frq gene expression alone is unable to reproduce the observed light-dependent phase responses. Indeed, we find that the depression of the transcriptional activator white-collar-1, previously shown to be promoted by FRQ and VVD, is a key molecular mechanism for accurately simulating light-induced phase response curves for wild-type and mutant strains of Neurospora. Our findings elucidate specific molecular pathways that can be utilized to control phase resetting of circadian rhythms.",?,Biophysical journal,Ohio,2018 Sep 18

The dual activities are essential for the production of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), the precursors of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in N. crassa. Here, we report five complex structures of N-terminal truncated QDE-1 (QDE-1DeltaN), representing four different reaction states: DNA/RNA-templated elongation, the de novo initiation of RNA synthesis, the first step of nucleotide condensation during de novo initiation and initial NTP loading.

The bright light treatment can be applied up to 76 h prior to dim exposure, and it can be as short as 15 min in duration. We have characterized this response in respect to the duration of the light pulse, the time of the light pulse before dim, the intensity of dim light, and the oscillation dynamics in dim light. Although the molecular mechanism that drives the BDOR remains obscure, these findings suggest that a long-term memory of bright light exists as part of the circadian molecular components. It is important to consider the ecological significance of such dim light responses in respect to how organisms naturally maintain their timing mechanism in moonlight.","['Neurospora', 'VIVID', 'WCC', 'circadian', 'dim light', 'frq', 'luminescence', 'moonlight']",Journal of biological rhythms,USA,2014 Feb
30255278,The Clock Keeps on Ticking: Emerging Roles for Circadian Regulation in the Control of Fungal Physiology and Pathogenesis.,"Tic-tac, tic-tac, the sound of time is familiar to us, yet, it also silently shapes daily biological processes conferring 24-hour rhythms in, among others, cellular and systemic signaling, gene expression, and metabolism. Indeed, circadian clocks are molecular machines that permit temporal control of a variety of processes in individuals, with a close to 24-hour period, optimizing cellular dynamics in synchrony with daily environmental cycles. For over three decades, the molecular bases of these clocks have been extensively described in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, yet, there have been few molecular studies in fungi other than Neurospora, despite evidence of rhythmic phenomena in many fungal species, including pathogenic ones. This chapter will revise the mechanisms underlying clock regulation in the model fungus N. crassa, as well as recent findings obtained in several fungi. In particular, this chapter will review the effect of circadian regulation of virulence and organismal interactions, focusing on the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea, as well as several entomopathogenic fungi, including the behavior-manipulating species Ophiocordyceps kimflemingiae and Entomophthora muscae. Finally, this review will comment current efforts in the study of mammalian pathogenic fungi, while highlighting recent circadian lessons from parasites such as Trypanosoma and Plasmodium.

23962317,The N-terminal region of the Neurospora NDR kinase COT1 regulates morphology via its interactions with MOB2A/B.,"Nuclear Dbf2p-related (NDR) protein kinases are important for cell differentiation and polar morphogenesis in various organisms, yet some of their functions are still elusive. Dysfunction of the Neurospora crassa NDR kinase COT1 leads to cessation of tip extension and hyperbranching. NDR kinases require the physical interaction between the kinase's N-terminal region (NTR) and the MPS1-binding (MOB) proteins for their activity and functions. To study the interactions between COT1 and MOB2 proteins, we mutated several conserved residues and a novel phosphorylation site within the COT1 NTR. The phenotypes of these mutants suggest that the NTR is required for COT1 functions in regulating hyphal elongation and branching, asexual conidiation and germination. Interestingly, while both MOB2A and MOB2B promote proper hyphal growth, they have distinct COT1-dependent roles in regulation of macroconidiation. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate physical association of COT1 with both MOB2A and MOB2B, simultaneously. Furthermore, the binding of the two MOB2 proteins to COT1 is mediated by different residues at the COT1 NTR, suggesting a hetero-trimer is formed. Thus, although MOB2A/B may have some overlapping functions in regulating hyphal tip extension, their function is not redundant and they are both required for proper fungal development.",?,Molecular microbiology,Israel,2013 Oct
33542245,Somatic deficiency causes reproductive parasitism in a fungus.,"Some multicellular organisms can fuse because mergers potentially provide mutual benefits. However, experimental evolution in the fungus Neurospora crassa has demonstrated that free fusion of mycelia favours cheater lineages, but the mechanism and evolutionary dynamics of this exploitation are unknown. Here we show, paradoxically, that all convergently evolved cheater lineages have similar fusion deficiencies. These mutants are unable to initiate fusion but retain access to wild-type mycelia that fuse with them. This asymmetry reduces cheater-mutant contributions to somatic substrate-bound hyphal networks, but increases representation of their nuclei in the aerial reproductive hyphae. Cheaters only benefit when relatively rare and likely impose genetic load reminiscent of germline senescence. We show that the consequences of somatic fusion can be unequally distributed among fusion partners, with the passive non-fusing partner profiting more. We discuss how our findings may relate to the extensive variation in fusion frequency of fungi found in nature.",?,Nature communications,The Netherlands,2021 Feb 4
25362047,Analysis of clock-regulated genes in Neurospora reveals widespread posttranscriptional control of metabolic potential.,"Neurospora crassa has been for decades a principal model for filamentous fungal genetics and physiology as well as for understanding the mechanism of circadian clocks. Eukaryotic fungal and animal clocks comprise transcription-translation-based feedback loops that control rhythmic transcription of a substantial fraction of these transcriptomes, yielding the changes in protein abundance that mediate circadian regulation of physiology and metabolism: Understanding circadian control of gene expression is key to understanding eukaryotic, including fungal, physiology. Indeed, the isolation of clock-controlled genes (ccgs) was pioneered in Neurospora where circadian output begins with binding of the core circadian transcription factor WCC to a subset of ccg promoters, including those of many transcription factors. High temporal resolution (2-h) sampling over 48 h using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) identified circadianly expressed genes in Neurospora, revealing that from  approximately 10% to as much 40% of the transcriptome can be expressed under circadian control. Functional classifications of these genes revealed strong enrichment in pathways involving metabolism, protein synthesis, and stress responses; in broad terms, daytime metabolic potential favors catabolism, energy production, and precursor assembly, whereas night activities favor biosynthesis of cellular components and growth. Discriminative regular expression motif elicitation (DREME) identified key promoter motifs highly correlated with the temporal regulation of ccgs. Correlations between ccg abundance from RNA-Seq, the degree of ccg-promoter activation as reported by ccg-promoter-luciferase fusions, and binding of WCC as measured by ChIP-Seq, are not strong. Therefore, although circadian activation is critical to ccg rhythmicity, posttranscriptional regulation plays a major role in determining rhythmicity at the mRNA level.","['Neurospora', 'RNA-Seq', 'circadian', 'clock-controlled genes', 'transcription']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,NH 03755,2014 Dec 2
25863073,Mathematical modeling and validation of glucose compensation of the neurospora circadian clock.,"Autonomous circadian oscillations arise from transcriptional-translational feedback loops of core clock components. The period of a circadian oscillator is relatively insensitive to changes in nutrients (e.g., glucose), which is referred to as ""nutrient compensation"". Recently, a transcription repressor, CSP-1, was identified as a component of the circadian system in Neurospora crassa. The transcription of csp-1 is under the circadian regulation. Intriguingly, CSP-1 represses the circadian transcription factor, WC-1, forming a negative feedback loop that can influence the core oscillator. This feedback mechanism is suggested to maintain the circadian period in a wide range of glucose concentrations. In this report, we constructed a mathematical model of the Neurospora circadian clock incorporating the above WC-1/CSP-1 feedback loop, and investigated molecular mechanisms of glucose compensation. Our model shows that glucose compensation exists within a narrow range of parameter space where the activation rates of csp-1 and wc-1 are balanced with each other, and simulates loss of glucose compensation in csp-1 mutants. More importantly, we experimentally validated rhythmic oscillations of the wc-1 gene expression and loss of glucose compensation in the wc-1(ov) mutant as predicted in the model. Furthermore, our stochastic simulations demonstrate that the CSP-1-dependent negative feedback loop functions in glucose compensation, but does not enhance the overall robustness of oscillations against molecular noise. Our work highlights predictive modeling of circadian clock machinery and experimental validations employing Neurospora and brings a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms of glucose compensation.",?,Biophysical journal,Ohio,2015 Apr 7
25822411,Combinatorial control of light induced chromatin remodeling and gene activation in Neurospora.,"Light is an important environmental cue that affects physiology and development of Neurospora crassa. The light-sensing transcription factor (TF) WCC, which consists of the GATA-family TFs WC1 and WC2, is required for light-dependent transcription. SUB1, another GATA-family TF, is not a photoreceptor but has also been implicated in light-inducible gene expression. To assess regulation and organization of the network of light-inducible genes, we analyzed the roles of WCC and SUB1 in light-induced transcription and nucleosome remodeling. We show that SUB1 co-regulates a fraction of light-inducible genes together with the WCC. WCC induces nucleosome eviction at its binding sites. Chromatin remodeling is facilitated by SUB1 but SUB1 cannot activate light-inducible genes in the absence of WCC. We identified FF7, a TF with a putative O-acetyl transferase domain, as an interaction partner of SUB1 and show their cooperation in regulation of a fraction of light-inducible and a much larger number of non light-inducible genes. Our data suggest that WCC acts as a general switch for light-induced chromatin remodeling and gene expression. SUB1 and FF7 synergistically determine the extent of light-induction of target genes in common with WCC but have in addition a role in transcription regulation beyond light-induced gene expression.",?,PLoS genetics,Germany,2015 Mar
26136227,Tuning the phase of circadian entrainment.,"The circadian clock coordinates daily physiological, metabolic and behavioural rhythms. These endogenous oscillations are synchronized with external cues ('zeitgebers'), such as daily light and temperature cycles. When the circadian clock is entrained by a zeitgeber, the phase difference psi between the phase of a clock-controlled rhythm and the phase of the zeitgeber is of fundamental importance for the fitness of the organism. The phase of entrainment psi depends on the mismatch between the intrinsic period tau and the zeitgeber period T and on the ratio of the zeitgeber strength to oscillator amplitude. Motivated by the intriguing complexity of empirical data and by our own experiments on temperature entrainment of mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) slices, we present a theory on how clock and zeitgeber properties determine the phase of entrainment. The wide applicability of the theory is demonstrated using mathematical models of different complexity as well as by experimental data. Predictions of the theory are confirmed by published data on Neurospora crassa strains for different period mismatches tau - T and varying photoperiods. We apply a novel regression technique to analyse entrainment of SCN slices by temperature cycles. We find that mathematical models can explain not only the stable asymptotic phase of entrainment, but also transient phase dynamics. Our theory provides the potential to explore seasonal variations of circadian rhythms, jet lag and shift work in forthcoming studies.","['chronotype', 'circadian clock', 'entrainment phase', 'mathematical model']","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",Germany grigory.bordyugov@hu-berlin.de,2015 Jul 6
27815222,Reorganization of plasma membrane lipid domains during conidial germination.,"Neurospora crassa, a filamentous fungus, in the unicellular conidial stage has ideal features to study sphingolipid (SL)-enriched domains, which are implicated in fundamental cellular processes ranging from antifungal resistance to apoptosis. Several changes in lipid metabolism and in the membrane composition of N. crassa occur during spore germination. However, the biophysical impact of those changes is unknown. Thus, a biophysical study of N. crassa plasma membrane, particularly SL-enriched domains, and their dynamics along conidial germination is prompted. Two N. crassa strains, wild-type (WT) and slime, which is devoid of cell wall, were studied. Conidial growth of N. crassa WT from a dormancy state to an exponential phase was accompanied by membrane reorganization, namely an increase of membrane fluidity, occurring faster in a supplemented medium than in Vogel's minimal medium. Gel-like domains, likely enriched in SLs, were found in both N. crassa strains, but were particularly compact, rigid and abundant in the case of slime cells, even more than in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In N. crassa, our results suggest that the melting of SL-enriched domains occurs near growth temperature (30 degrees C) for WT, but at higher temperatures for slime. Regarding biophysical properties strongly affected by ergosterol, the plasma membrane of slime conidia lays in between those of N. crassa WT and S. cerevisiae cells. The differences in biophysical properties found in this work, and the relationships established between membrane lipid composition and dynamics, give new insights about the plasma membrane organization and structure of N. crassa strains during conidial growth.","['Ergosterol', 'Fluorescence spectroscopy', 'Fungal sphingolipids', 'Lipid domains/rafts', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae']",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

The vectorial movements of all three were strongly correlated, indicating the central role of mass (bulk) flow in cytoplasm movements in N. crassa. Profiles of velocity versus distance from the hyphal wall did not match the parabolic shape predicted by the ideal Hagen-Poiseuille model of flow at low Reynolds number. Instead, the profiles were flat, consistent with a model of partial plug flow due to the high concentration of organelles in the flowing cytosol. The intra-hyphal pressure gradients were manipulated by localized external osmotic treatments to demonstrate the dependence of velocity (and direction) on pressure gradients within the hyphae. The data support the concept that mass transport, driven by pressure gradients, dominates intra-hyphal transport. The transport occurs by partial plug flow due to the organelles in the cytosol.",?,"Microbiology (Reading, England)",Canada,2013 Nov
27587717,Neurons show the path: tip-to-nucleus communication in filamentous fungal development and pathogenesis.,"Multiple fungal species penetrate substrates and accomplish host invasion through the fast, permanent and unidirectional extension of filamentous cells known as hyphae. Polar growth of hyphae results, however, in a significant increase in the distance between the polarity site, which also receives the earliest information about ambient conditions, and nuclei, where adaptive responses are executed. Recent studies demonstrate that these long distances are overcome by signal transduction pathways which convey sensory information from the polarity site to nuclei, controlling development and pathogenesis. The present review compares the striking connections of the mechanisms for long-distance communication in hyphae with those from neurons, and discusses the importance of their study in order to understand invasion and dissemination processes of filamentous fungi, and design strategies for developmental control in the future.","['development', 'filamentous fungi', 'neuronal polarization', 'polar growth', 'signal transduction', 'vegetative hyphae']",FEMS microbiology reviews,Spain oier.echeveste@ehu.eus,2016 Sep
31554810,FRQ-CK1 interaction determines the period of circadian rhythms in Neurospora.,"Circadian clock mechanisms have been extensively investigated but the main rate-limiting step that determines circadian period remains unclear. Formation of a stable complex between clock proteins and CK1 is a conserved feature in eukaryotic circadian mechanisms. Here we show that the FRQ-CK1 interaction, but not FRQ stability, correlates with circadian period in Neurospora circadian clock mutants. Mutations that specifically affect the FRQ-CK1 interaction lead to severe alterations in circadian period. The FRQ-CK1 interaction has two roles in the circadian negative feedback loop. First, it determines the FRQ phosphorylation profile, which regulates FRQ stability and also feeds back to either promote or reduce the interaction itself. Second, it determines the efficiency of circadian negative feedback process by mediating FRQ-dependent WC phosphorylation. Our conclusions are further supported by mathematical modeling and in silico experiments. Together, these results suggest that the FRQ-CK1 interaction is a major rate-limiting step in circadian period determination.",?,Nature communications,USA,2019 Sep 25

In this study, we evaluated the potential of a non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet to improve the production efficiency of cellulolytic enzymes in Neurospora crassa, a filamentous fungus. The total activity of cellulolytic enzymes and protein concentration were significantly increased (1.1~1.2 times) in media containing Avicel 24-72 h after 2 and 5 min of plasma treatment. The mRNA levels of four cellulolytic enzymes in fungal hyphae grown in media with Avicel were significantly increased (1.3~17 times) 2-4 h after a 5 min of plasma treatment. The levels of intracellular NO and Ca(2+) were increased in plasma-treated fungal hyphae grown in Avicel media after 48 h, and the removal of intracellular NO decreased the activity of cellulolytic enzymes in media and the level of vesicles in fungal hyphae. Our data suggest that plasma treatment can promote the transcription and secretion of cellulolytic enzymes into the culture media in the presence of Avicel (induction condition) by enhancing the intracellular level of NO and Ca(2+).","['Neurospora crassa', 'calcium accumulation', 'cellulase', 'enzyme production', 'nitric oxide', 'plasma jet']",International journal of molecular sciences,Korea,2022 Jun 15
33295874,PRD-2 directly regulates casein kinase I and counteracts nonsense-mediated decay in the Neurospora circadian clock.,"Circadian clocks in fungi and animals are driven by a functionally conserved transcription-translation feedback loop. In Neurospora crassa, negative feedback is executed by a complex of Frequency (FRQ), FRQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH), and casein kinase I (CKI), which inhibits the activity of the clock's positive arm, the White Collar Complex (WCC). Here, we show that the prd-2 (period-2) gene, whose mutation is characterized by recessive inheritance of a long 26 hr period phenotype, encodes an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes the ck-1a transcript, resulting in CKI protein levels sufficient for normal rhythmicity. Moreover, by examining the molecular basis for the short circadian period of upf-1(prd-6) mutants, we uncovered a strong influence of the Nonsense Mediated Decay pathway on CKI levels. The finding that circadian period defects in two classically derived Neurospora clock mutants each arise from disruption of ck-1a regulation is consistent with circadian period being exquisitely sensitive to levels of casein kinase I.","['Casein Kinase I', 'N. crassa', 'RNA-binding protein', 'SUZ domain', 'circadian clock', 'genetics', 'genomics', 'neurospora', 'nonsense mediated decay', 'prd-2, upf1 / prd-6']",eLife,United States,2020 Dec 9

The progeny from crosses of T(IBj5)(Nt)a and T(B362i)(Nt)A with opposite mating-type derivatives of the standard N. tetrasperma strain 85 exhibited a unique and unprecedented transmission ratio distortion (TRD) that disfavored homokaryons produced following alternate segregation relative to those produced following adjacent-1 segregation. The TRD was not evident among the [mat A + mat a] dikaryons produced following either segregation. Further, crosses of the T(IBj5)(Nt)a and T(B362i)(Nt)A strains with the Eight spore (E) mutant showed an unusual ascus phenotype called 'max-4'. We propose that the TRD and the max-4 phenotype are manifestations of the same Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (BDMI). Since the TRD selects against 2/3 of the homokaryotic progeny from each introgression cross, the BDMI would have enriched for the dikaryotic progeny in the viable ascospores, and thus, paradoxically, facilitated the introgressions.",?,Journal of biosciences,India,2020

23712010,The Neurospora photoreceptor VIVID exerts negative and positive control on light sensing to achieve adaptation.,"The light response in Neurospora is mediated by the photoreceptor and circadian transcription factor White Collar Complex (WCC). The expression rate of the WCC target genes adapts in daylight and remains refractory to moonlight, despite the extraordinary light sensitivity of the WCC. To explain this photoadaptation, feedback inhibition by the WCC interaction partner VIVID (VVD) has been invoked. Here we show through data-driven mathematical modeling that VVD allows Neurospora to detect relative changes in light intensity. To achieve this behavior, VVD acts as an inhibitor of WCC-driven gene expression and, at the same time, as a positive regulator that maintains the responsiveness of the photosystem. Our data indicate that this paradoxical function is realized by a futile cycle that involves the light-induced sequestration of active WCC by VVD and the replenishment of the activatable WCC pool through the decay of the photoactivated state. Our quantitative study uncovers a novel network motif for achieving sensory adaptation and defines a core input module of the circadian clock in Neurospora.",?,Molecular systems biology,Germany,2013 May 28
25762222,Dawn- and dusk-phased circadian transcription rhythms coordinate anabolic and catabolic functions in Neurospora.,"BACKGROUND: Circadian clocks control rhythmic expression of a large number of genes in coordination with the 24 hour day-night cycle. The mechanisms generating circadian rhythms, their amplitude and circadian phase are dependent on a transcriptional network of immense complexity. Moreover, the contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms in generating rhythms in RNA abundance is not known. RESULTS: Here, we analyzed the clock-controlled transcriptome of Neurospora crassa together with temporal profiles of elongating RNA polymerase II. Our data indicate that transcription contributes to the rhythmic expression of the vast majority of clock-controlled genes (ccgs) in Neurospora. The ccgs accumulate in two main clusters with peak transcription and expression levels either at dawn or dusk. Dawn-phased genes are predominantly involved in catabolic and dusk-phased genes in anabolic processes, indicating a clock-controlled temporal separation of the physiology of Neurospora. Genes whose expression is strongly dependent on the core circadian activator WCC fall mainly into the dawn-phased cluster while rhythmic genes regulated by the glucose-dependent repressor CSP1 fall predominantly into the dusk-phased cluster. Surprisingly, the number of rhythmic transcripts increases about twofold in the absence of CSP1, indicating that rhythmic expression of many genes is attenuated by the activity of CSP1. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that the vast majority of transcript rhythms in Neurospora are generated by dawn and dusk specific transcription. Our observations suggest a substantial plasticity of the circadian transcriptome with respect to the number of rhythmic genes as well as amplitude and phase of the expression rhythms and emphasize a major role of the circadian clock in the temporal organization of metabolism and physiology.",?,BMC biology,Germany. cigdem.sancar@bzh.uni-heidelberg.de,2015 Feb 24

33727355,Trade-off between Plasticity and Velocity in Mycelial Growth.,"Tip-growing fungal cells maintain cell polarity at the apical regions and elongate by de novo synthesis of the cell wall. Cell polarity and tip growth rate affect mycelial morphology. However, it remains unclear how both features act cooperatively to determine cell shape. Here, we investigated this relationship by analyzing hyphal tip growth of filamentous fungi growing inside extremely narrow 1 mum-width channels of microfluidic devices. Since the channels are much narrower than the diameter of hyphae, any hypha growing through the channel must adapt its morphology. Live-cell imaging analyses revealed that hyphae of some species continued growing through the channels, whereas hyphae of other species often ceased growing when passing through the channels, or had lost apical polarity after emerging from the other end of the channel. Fluorescence live-cell imaging analyses of the Spitzenkorper, a collection of secretory vesicles and polarity-related proteins at the hyphal tip, in Neurospora crassa indicates that hyphal tip growth requires a very delicate balance of ordered exocytosis to maintain polarity in spatially confined environments. We analyzed the mycelial growth of seven fungal species from different lineages, including phytopathogenic fungi. This comparative approach revealed that the growth defects induced by the channels were not correlated with their taxonomic classification or with the width of hyphae, but, rather, correlated with the hyphal elongation rate. This report indicates a trade-off between morphological plasticity and velocity in mycelial growth and serves to help understand fungal invasive growth into substrates or plant/animal cells, with direct impact on fungal biotechnology, ecology, and pathogenicity.IMPORTANCE Cell morphology, which is controlled by polarity and growth, is fundamental for all cellular functions. However how polarity and growth act cooperatively to control cell shape remains unclear. Here we investigated their relationship by analyzing hyphal tip growth of filamentous fungi growing inside extremely narrow 1 mum-width channels of microfluidic devices. We found that most fast growing hyphae often lost the cell polarity after emerging from the channels, whereas slow growing hyphae retained polarity and continued growing, indicating a trade-off between plasticity and velocity in mycelial growth.

In order to find out the critical genes involved in the mycelial morphology development and cellulases production in liquid fermentation, 95 Neurospora crassa morphological mutants (named as SZY1-95) were screened for cellulases production. Compared with the wild type, cellulases production in four mutants SZY32, SZY35, SZY39 and SZY43 were significantly decreased, whereas mutants SZY63, SZY69, SZY87 and SZY11 produced much more cellulases than that of the wild type strain. Meanwhile, endo-beta-1,4-glucanase activity, beta-glucosidase activity, viscosity of broth and dry weight of these mutants were measured. The mycelial morphology of the mutants was also studied by microscope. Particularly, pellets were formed in mutant SZY11 and SZY43, whose viscosities were 25% and 50% of the wild type strain, respectively. Mutant SZY87 appeared long hyphae, and the viscosity of its broth was at least 2 folds of the wild type strain. These results indicate that a single gene deletion could influence the mycelial morphology in liquid fermentation, and increased the cellulases production.

23861490,Nuclear dynamics in a fungal chimera.,"A fungal colony is a syncytium composed of a branched and interconnected network of cells. Chimerism endows colonies with increased virulence and ability to exploit nutritionally complex substrates. Moreover, chimera formation may be a driver for diversification at the species level by allowing lateral gene transfer between strains that are too distantly related to hybridize sexually. However, the processes by which genomic diversity develops and is maintained within a single colony are little understood. In particular, both theory and experiments show that genetically diverse colonies may be unstable and spontaneously segregate into genetically homogenous sectors. By directly measuring patterns of nuclear movement in the model ascomycete fungus Neurospora crassa, we show that genetic diversity is maintained by complex mixing flows of nuclei at all length scales within the hyphal network. Mathematical modeling and experiments in a morphological mutant reveal some of the exquisite hydraulic engineering necessary to create the mixing flows. In addition to illuminating multinucleate and multigenomic lifestyles, the adaptation of a hyphal network for mixing nuclear material provides a previously unexamined organizing principle for understanding morphological diversity in the more-than-a-million species of filamentous fungi.","['biological networks', 'heterokaryon', 'hydrodynamics']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,USA. mroper@math.ucla.edu,2013 Aug 6

A class of naturally unstructured proteins, termed intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), demonstrates that flexibility in structure can be as important mechanistically as rigid structure. At the core of the circadian transcription/translation feedback loop in Neurospora crassa is the protein FREQUENCY (FRQ), shown here shown to share many characteristics of IDPs. FRQ in turn binds to FREQUENCY-Interacting RNA Helicase (FRH), whose clock function has been assumed to relate to its predicted helicase function. However, mutational analyses reveal that the helicase function of FRH is not essential for the clock, and a region of FRH distinct from the helicase region is essential for stabilizing FRQ against rapid degradation via a pathway distinct from its typical ubiquitin-mediated turnover. These data lead to the hypothesis that FRQ is an IDP and that FRH acts nonenzymatically, stabilizing FRQ to enable proper clock circuitry/function.",?,Molecular cell,USA,2013 Dec 26
34568932,Involvement of RNA granule proteins in meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA.,"In Neurospora crassa, expression from an unpaired gene is suppressed by a mechanism known as meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). MSUD utilizes common RNA interference (RNAi) factors to silence target mRNAs. Here, we report that Neurospora CAR-1 and CGH-1, homologs of two Caenorhabditis elegans RNA granule components, are involved in MSUD. These fungal proteins are found in the perinuclear region and P-bodies, much like their worm counterparts. They interact with components of the meiotic silencing complex (MSC), including the SMS-2 Argonaute. This is the first time MSUD has been linked to RNA granule proteins.","['Neurospora crassa', 'P-bodies', 'RNA granules', 'RNA interference (RNAi)', 'meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD)']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",USA,2021 Sep 27
30715860,Interaction between Cellobiose Dehydrogenase and Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase.,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are ubiquitous oxidoreductases, facilitating the degradation of polymeric carbohydrates in biomass. Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is a biologically relevant electron donor in this process, with the electrons resulting from cellobiose oxidation being shuttled from the CDH dehydrogenase domain to its cytochrome domain and then to the LPMO catalytic site. In this work, we investigate the interaction of four Neurospora crassa LPMOs and five CDH cytochrome domains from different species using computational methods. We used HADDOCK to perform protein-protein docking experiments on all 20 combinations and subsequently to select four complexes for extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The potential of mean force is computed for a rotation of the cytochrome domain relative to LPMO. We find that the LPMO loops are largely responsible for the preferred orientations of the cytochrome domains. This leads us to postulate a hybrid version of NcLPMO9F, with exchanged loops and predicted altered cytochrome binding preferences for this variant. Our work provides insight into the possible mechanisms of electron transfer between the two protein systems, in agreement with and complementary to previously published experimental data.",?,Biochemistry,Austria,2019 Mar 5
33712585,Discovery of fungal surface NADases predominantly present in pathogenic species.,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key molecule in cellular bioenergetics and signalling. Various bacterial pathogens release NADase enzymes into the host cell that deplete the host's NAD(+) pool, thereby causing rapid cell death. Here, we report the identification of NADases on the surface of fungi such as the pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and the saprophyte Neurospora crassa. The enzymes harbour a tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (TNT) domain and are predominately present in pathogenic species. The 1.6 A X-ray structure of the homodimeric A. fumigatus protein reveals unique properties including N-linked glycosylation and a Ca(2+)-binding site whose occupancy regulates activity. The structure in complex with a substrate analogue suggests a catalytic mechanism that is distinct from those of known NADases, ADP-ribosyl cyclases and transferases. We propose that fungal NADases may convey advantages during interaction with the host or competing microorganisms.",?,Nature communications,Norway,2021 Mar 12
24028079,HAM-2 and HAM-3 are central for the assembly of the Neurospora STRIPAK complex at the nuclear envelope and regulate nuclear accumulation of the MAP kinase MAK-1 in a MAK-2-dependent manner.,"Intercellular communication and somatic cell fusion are important for fungal colony establishment, multicellular differentiation and have been associated with host colonization and virulence of pathogenic species. By a combination of genetic, biochemical and live cell imaging techniques, we characterized the Neurospora crassa STRIPAK complex that is essential for self-signalling and consists of the six proteins HAM-2/STRIP, HAM-3/striatin, HAM-4/SLMAP, MOB-3/phocein, PPG-1/PP2A-C and PP2A-A. We describe that the core STRIPAK components HAM-2 and HAM-3 are central for the assembly of the complex at the nuclear envelope, while the phosphatase PPG-1 only transiently associates with this central subcomplex. Our data connect the STRIPAK complex with two MAP kinase pathways: (i) nuclear accumulation of the cell wall integrity MAP kinase MAK-1 depends on the functional integrity of the STRIPAK complex at the nuclear envelope, and (ii) phosphorylation of MOB-3 by the MAP kinase MAK-2 impacts the nuclear accumulation of MAK-1. In summary, these data support a model, in which MAK-2-dependent phosphorylation of MOB-3 is part of a MAK-1 import mechanism. Although self-communication remained intact in the absence of nuclear MAK-1 accumulation, supporting the presence of multiple mechanisms that co-ordinate robust intercellular communication, proper fruiting body morphology was dependent on the MAK-2-phosphorylated N-terminus of MOB-3.",?,Molecular microbiology,Germany,2013 Nov
31213536,Intracellular mechanisms of fungal space searching in microenvironments.,"Filamentous fungi that colonize microenvironments, such as animal or plant tissue or soil, must find optimal paths through their habitat, but the biological basis for negotiating growth in constrained environments is unknown. We used time-lapse live-cell imaging of Neurospora crassa in microfluidic environments to show how constraining geometries determine the intracellular processes responsible for fungal growth. We found that, if a hypha made contact with obstacles at acute angles, the Spitzenkorper (an assembly of vesicles) moved from the center of the apical dome closer to the obstacle, thus functioning as an internal gyroscope, which preserved the information regarding the initial growth direction. Additionally, the off-axis trajectory of the Spitzenkorper was tracked by microtubules exhibiting ""cutting corner"" patterns. By contrast, if a hypha made contact with an obstacle at near-orthogonal incidence, the directional memory was lost, due to the temporary collapse of the Spitzenkorper-microtubule system, followed by the formation of two ""daughter"" hyphae growing in opposite directions along the contour of the obstacle. Finally, a hypha passing a lateral opening in constraining channels continued to grow unperturbed, but a daughter hypha gradually branched into the opening and formed its own Spitzenkorper-microtubule system. These observations suggest that the Spitzenkorper-microtubule system is responsible for efficient space partitioning in microenvironments, but, in its absence during constraint-induced apical splitting and lateral branching, the directional memory is lost, and growth is driven solely by the isotropic turgor pressure. These results further our understanding of fungal growth in microenvironments relevant to environmental, industrial, and medical applications.","['Spitzenkorper', 'fungal growth', 'live-cell imaging', 'microfluidics', 'microtubules']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,United Kingdom,2019 Jul 2
34182778,Cellular Calcium Levels Influenced by NCA-2 Impact Circadian Period Determination in Neurospora.,"Intracellular calcium signaling has been implicated in the control of a variety of circadian processes in animals and plants, but its role in microbial clocks has remained largely cryptic. To examine the role of intracellular Ca(2+) in the Neurospora clock, we screened mutants with knockouts of calcium transporter genes and identified a gene encoding a calcium exporter, nca-2, uniquely as having significant period effects. The loss of NCA-2 results in an increase in the cytosolic calcium level, and this leads to hyper-phosphorylation of core clock components, FRQ and WC-1, and a short period, as measured by both the core oscillator and the overt clock. Genetic analyses showed that mutations in certain frq phospho-sites and in Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (camk-2) are epistatic to nca-2 in controlling the pace of the oscillator. These data are consistent with a model in which elevated intracellular Ca(2+) leads to the increased activity of CAMK-2, leading to enhanced FRQ phosphorylation, accelerated closure of the circadian feedback loop, and a shortened circadian period length. At a mechanistic level, some CAMKs undergo more auto-phosphorylations in the Deltanca-2 mutant, consistent with high calcium levels in the Deltanca-2 mutant influencing the enzymatic activities of CAMKs. NCA-2 interacts with multiple proteins, including CSP-6, a protein known to be required for circadian output. Most importantly, the expression of nca-2 is circadian clock-controlled at both the transcriptional and translational levels, and this in combination with the period effects seen in strains lacking NCA-2 firmly places calcium signaling within the larger circadian system, where it acts as both an input to and an output from the core clock. IMPORTANCE Circadian rhythms are based on cell-autonomous, auto-regulatory feedback loops formed by interlocked positive and negative arms, and they regulate myriad molecular and cellular processes in most eukaryotes, including fungi. Intracellular calcium signaling is also a process that impacts a broad range of biological events in most eukaryotes. Clues have suggested that calcium signaling can influence circadian oscillators through multiple pathways; however, mechanistic details have been lacking in microorganisms. When we built on prior work describing calcium transporters in the fungus Neurospora, one such transporter, NCA-2, was identified as a regulator of circadian period length. Increased intracellular calcium levels caused by the loss of NCA-2 resulted in overactivation of calcium-responsive protein kinases, in turn leading to a shortened circadian period length. Importantly, the expression of NCA-2 is itself controlled by the molecular clock. In this way, calcium signaling can be seen as providing both input to and output from the circadian system.","['CAMK', 'Ca2+-CaM-dependent kinases', 'FRQ', 'FRQ phosphorylation', 'calcium', 'nca-2']",mBio,USA,2021 Jun 29
36898580,"Differential regulation of phosphorylation, structure, and stability of circadian clock protein FRQ isoforms.","Neurospora crassa is an important model organism for circadian clock research. The Neurospora core circadian component FRQ protein has two isoforms, large FRQ (l-FRQ) and small FRQ (s-FRQ), of which l-FRQ bears an additional N-terminal 99-amino acid fragment. However, how the FRQ isoforms operate differentially in regulating the circadian clock remains elusive. Here, we show l-FRQ and s-FRQ play different roles in regulating the circadian negative feedback loop. Compared to s-FRQ, l-FRQ is less stable and undergoes hypophosphorylation and faster degradation. The phosphorylation of the C-terminal l-FRQ 794-aa fragment was markedly higher than that of s-FRQ, suggesting the l-FRQ N-terminal 99-aa region may regulate the phosphorylation of the entire FRQ protein. Quantitative label-free LC/MS analysis identified several peptides that were differentially phosphorylated between l-FRQ and s-FRQ, which were distributed in FRQ in an interlaced fashion. Furthermore, we identified two novel phosphorylation sites, S765 and T781; mutations S765A and T781A showed no significant effects on conidiation rhythmicity, although T781 conferred FRQ stability. These findings demonstrate that FRQ isoforms play differential roles in the circadian negative feedback loop and undergo different regulations of phosphorylation, structure, and stability. The l-FRQ N-terminal 99-aa region plays an important role in regulating the phosphorylation, stability, conformation, and function of the FRQ protein. As the FRQ circadian clock counterparts in other species also have isoforms or paralogues, these findings will also further our understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the circadian clock in other organisms based on the high conservation of circadian clocks in eukaryotes.","['FREQUENCY (FRQ)', 'Neurospora crassa', 'circadian clock', 'conformation', 'phosphorylation']",The Journal of biological chemistry,China,2023 Apr

Delayed negative feedback loops with switch-like inhibition of transcription constitute the core of eukaryotic circadian clocks. The kinetics of core clock proteins such as PER2 in mammals and FRQ in Neurospora crassa is governed by multiple phosphorylations. We investigate how multiple, slow and random phosphorylations control delay and molecular switches. We model phosphorylations of intrinsically disordered clock proteins (IDPs) using conceptual models of sequential and distributive phosphorylations. Our models help to understand the underlying mechanisms leading to delays and ultrasensitivity. The model shows temporal and steady state switches for the free kinase and the phosphoprotein. We show that random phosphorylations and sequestration mechanisms allow high Hill coefficients required for self-sustained oscillations.",?,Scientific reports,Germany. abhibiotechnologist@gmail.com,2020 Dec 17
30468429,ASH1-catalyzed H3K36 methylation drives gene repression and marks H3K27me2/3-competent chromatin.,"Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me), a widely-distributed chromatin mark, largely results from association of the lysine methyltransferase (KMT) SET-2 with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), but most eukaryotes also have additional H3K36me KMTs that act independently of RNAPII. These include the orthologs of ASH1, which are conserved in animals, plants, and fungi but whose function and control are poorly understood. We found that Neurospora crassa has just two H3K36 KMTs, ASH1 and SET-2, and were able to explore the function and distribution of each enzyme independently. While H3K36me deposited by SET-2 marks active genes, inactive genes are modified by ASH1 and its activity is critical for their repression. ASH1-marked chromatin can be further modified by methylation of H3K27, and ASH1 catalytic activity modulates the accumulation of H3K27me2/3 both positively and negatively. These findings provide new insight into ASH1 function, H3K27me2/3 establishment, and repression in facultative heterochromatin.","['H3K27 methylation', 'H3K36 methylation', 'N. crassa', 'Set2', 'chromosomes', 'gene expression', 'gene silencing', 'genetics', 'genomics', 'heterochromatin', 'transcription']",eLife,United States,2018 Nov 23

Depending on nitrogen source and intactness of nitrite reductase (NiR) and nitrate reductase (NR), light and dehydration affected the number of viable conidia produced by the ascomycete. In most variants of the nitrogen status, the combined action of light and dehydration synergistically increased the conidia yield. Conidiation in wild-type cells cultivated on the medium with NH4Cl as a sole nitrogen source did not respond to light, whereas illumination of the same culture grown on NH4NO3- or NaNO3-containing medium stimulated the process of spore formation. In response to light exposure, conidia formation occurred in the same way in the nit-2 (no NR and NiR) and nit-6 (no NiR) mutants cultivated in the presence of NH4Cl, but differed greatly when grown on the medium with NH4NO3. The results obtained indicate the possibility that NR and NiR participate in the photoconidiation regulation (wild-type strain on the medium with secondary nitrogen source); however, they cannot be necessary because light-dependent stimulation of spore formation was observed in nit-2 and nit-6 mutants.",?,Prikladnaia biokhimiia i mikrobiologiia,,2015 May-Jun
26907693,Functional Evolution in Orthologous Cell-encoded RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases.,"Many eukaryotic organisms encode more than one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that probably emerged as a result of gene duplication. Such RdRP paralogs often participate in distinct RNA silencing pathways and show characteristic repertoires of enzymatic activities in vitro However, to what extent members of individual paralogous groups can undergo functional changes during speciation remains an open question. We show that orthologs of QDE-1, an RdRP component of the quelling pathway in Neurospora crassa, have rapidly diverged in evolution at the amino acid sequence level. Analyses of purified QDE-1 polymerases from N. crassa (QDE-1(Ncr)) and related fungi, Thielavia terrestris (QDE-1(Tte)) and Myceliophthora thermophila (QDE-1(Mth)), show that all three enzymes can synthesize RNA, but the precise modes of their action differ considerably. Unlike their QDE-1(Ncr) counterpart favoring processive RNA synthesis, QDE-1(Tte) and QDE-1(Mth) produce predominantly short RNA copies via primer-independent initiation. Surprisingly, a 3.19 A resolution crystal structure of QDE-1(Tte) reveals a quasisymmetric dimer similar to QDE-1(Ncr) Further electron microscopy analyses confirm that QDE-1(Tte) occurs as a dimer in solution and retains this status upon interaction with a template. We conclude that divergence of orthologous RdRPs can result in functional innovation while retaining overall protein fold and quaternary structure.","['RNA interference (RNAi)', 'RNA polymerase', 'RNA-dependent RNA polymerase', 'electron microscopy (EM)', 'protein evolution', 'x-ray crystallography']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Singapore,2016 Apr 22

The dismutation of hydrogen peroxide occurs in two steps; in the first one, the enzyme forms an oxidized compound I (Cpd I) and in the second one, the enzyme is reduced to the ferric state. In this research work, we analyzed the reduction of Cpd I by X-ray radiation damage during diffraction experiments in crystals of CAT-3, a Large-Size Subunit Catalase (LSC) from Neurospora crassa. A Multi-Crystal Data collection Strategy was applied in order to obtain the Cpd I structure at a resolution of 2.2â€¯A; this intermediate was highly sensitive to X-ray and was easily reduced at very low deposited radiation dose, causing breakage of the Fe=O bond. The comparison of the structures showed reduced intermediates and also evidenced the differential sensitivity per monomer. The resting ferric state was reduced to the ferrous state, an intermediate without a previous report in LSC. The chemically obtained Cpd I and the X-ray reduced intermediates were identified by UV-visible microspectrometry coupled to data collection. The differential sensitivity and the formation of a ferrous state are discussed, emphasizing the importance of the correct interpretation in the oxidation state of the iron heme.","['Catalase', 'Composite datasets', 'Compound I', 'Ferrous heme', 'X-ray reduction']",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,Mexico,2019 May 15

35156426,A Unified Model for Entrainment by Circadian Clocks: Dynamic Circadian Integrated Response Characteristic (dCiRC).,"Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous and are observed in all biological kingdoms. In nature, their primary characteristic or phenotype is the phase of entrainment. There are two main hypotheses related to how circadian clocks entrain, parametric and non-parametric models. The parametric model focuses on the gradual changes of the clock parameters in response to the changing ambient condition, whereas the non-parametric model focuses on the instantaneous change of the phase of the clock in response to the zeitgeber. There are ample empirical data supporting both models. However, only recently has a unifying model been proposed, the circadian integrated response characteristic (CiRC). In the current study, we developed a system of ordinary differential equations, dynamic CiRC (dCiRC), that describes parameters of circadian rhythms and predicts the phase of entrainment in zeitgeber cycles. dCiRC mathematically extracts the underlying information of velocity changes of the internal clock that reflects the parametric model and the phase shift trajectory that reflects the non-parametric model from phase data under entraining conditions. As a proof of concept, we measured clock parameters of 26 Neurospora crassa ecotypes in both cycling and constant conditions using dCiRC. Our data showed that the morning light shortens the period of the clock while the afternoon light lengthens it. We also found that individual ecotypes have different strategies of integrating light effects to accomplish the optimal phase of entrainment, a model feature that is consistent with our knowledge of how circadian clocks are organized and encoded. The unified model dCiRC will provide new insights into how circadian clocks function under different zeitgeber conditions. We suggest that this type of model may be useful in the advent of chronotherapies.","['CiRC', 'Neurospora crassa', 'entrainment', 'mathematical modeling', 'non-parametric model', 'parametric model']",Journal of biological rhythms,USA,2022 Apr

Continued development and optimization in GECIs, combined with advances in gene manipulation, offer new opportunities for investigating the mechanism of Ca(2+) signaling in fungi, ranging from documenting Ca(2+) signatures under diverse conditions and genetic backgrounds to evaluating how changes in Ca(2+) signature impact calcium-binding proteins and subsequent cellular changes. Here, we attempted to express multi-color (green, yellow, blue, cyan, and red) circularly permuted fluorescent protein (FP)-based Ca(2+) indicators driven by multiple fungal promoters in Fusarium oxysporum, F. graminearum, and Neurospora crassa.

Here we describe a simple method for producing functionally active class I and class II hydrophobins in E. coli. The class I hydrophobin EAS (rodlet protein) from Neurospora crassa and class II hydrophobin HFBII from Trichoderma reesei were separately fused with fusion partner Ffu312 (beta-fructofuranosidase truncation with a native signal peptide) and successfully expressed in E. coli. Significantly, fused hydrophobins Ffu312-EAS and Ffu312-HFBII were excreted into the culture medium. The excretory expression of hydrophobins facilitated the correct disulfide-bond formation and simplified the purification. Both fusion hydrophobins reversed the glass surface hydrophilicity, reduced the water surface tension and improved emulsion stability. Ffu312 has little effect on surface coating, water surface tension and emulsion stabilization of hydrophobins.

34509507,Modulation of C-to-T mutation by recombination-independent pairing of closely positioned DNA repeats.,"Repeat-induced point mutation is a genetic process that creates cytosine-to-thymine (C-to-T) transitions in duplicated genomic sequences in fungi. Repeat-induced point mutation detects duplications (irrespective of their origin, specific sequence, coding capacity, and genomic positions) by a recombination-independent mechanism that likely matches intact DNA double helices directly, without relying on the annealing of complementary single strands. In the fungus Neurospora crassa, closely positioned repeats can induce mutation of the adjoining nonrepetitive regions. This process is related to heterochromatin assembly and requires the cytosine methyltransferase DIM-2. Using DIM-2-dependent mutation as a readout of homologous pairing, we find that GC-rich repeats produce a much stronger response than AT-rich repeats, independently of their intrinsic propensity to become mutated. We also report that direct repeats trigger much stronger DIM-2-dependent mutation than inverted repeats. These results can be rationalized in the light of a recently proposed model of homologous DNA pairing, in which DNA double helices associate by forming sequence-specific quadruplex-based contacts with a concomitant release of supercoiling. A similar process featuring pairing-induced supercoiling may initiate epigenetic silencing of repetitive DNA in other organisms, including humans.",?,Biophysical journal,France,2021 Oct 19

In this work, we report on the modular optimization of the fungal light-oxygen-voltage (FUN-LOV) system, an optogenetic switch based on photoreceptors from the fungus Neurospora crassa. We also describe new switch variants obtained by replacing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) of FUN-LOV with nine different DBDs from yeast transcription factors of the zinc cluster family. Among the tested modules, the variant carrying the Hap1p DBD, which we call ""HAP-LOV"", displayed higher levels of luciferase expression upon induction compared to FUN-LOV. Further, the combination of the Hap1p DBD with either p65 or VP16 activation domains also resulted in higher levels of reporter expression compared to the original switch. Finally, we assessed the effects of the plasmid copy number and promoter strength controlling the expression of the FUN-LOV and HAP-LOV components, and observed that when low-copy plasmids and strong promoters were used, a stronger response was achieved in both systems. Altogether, we describe a new set of blue-light optogenetic switches carrying different protein modules, which expands the available suite of optogenetic tools in yeast and can additionally be applied to other systems.","['blue-light switch', 'gene expression', 'optogenetics', 'yeast']",International journal of molecular sciences,Chile,2021 Aug 9
32111691,The regulatory and transcriptional landscape associated with carbon utilization in a filamentous fungus.,"Filamentous fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, are very efficient in deconstructing plant biomass by the secretion of an arsenal of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, by remodeling metabolism to accommodate production of secreted enzymes, and by enabling transport and intracellular utilization of plant biomass components. Although a number of enzymes and transcriptional regulators involved in plant biomass utilization have been identified, how filamentous fungi sense and integrate nutritional information encoded in the plant cell wall into a regulatory hierarchy for optimal utilization of complex carbon sources is not understood. Here, we performed transcriptional profiling of N. crassa on 40 different carbon sources, including plant biomass, to provide data on how fungi sense simple to complex carbohydrates. From these data, we identified regulatory factors in N. crassa and characterized one (PDR-2) associated with pectin utilization and one with pectin/hemicellulose utilization (ARA-1). Using in vitro DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), we identified direct targets of transcription factors involved in regulating genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. In particular, our data clarified the role of the transcription factor VIB-1 in the regulation of genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and nutrient scavenging and revealed a major role of the carbon catabolite repressor CRE-1 in regulating the expression of major facilitator transporter genes.

32355000,Circadian clock control of eIF2alpha phosphorylation is necessary for rhythmic translation initiation.,"The circadian clock in eukaryotes controls transcriptional and posttranscriptional events, including regulation of the levels and phosphorylation state of translation factors. However, the mechanisms underlying clock control of translation initiation, and the impact of this potential regulation on rhythmic protein synthesis, were not known. We show that inhibitory phosphorylation of eIF2alpha (P-eIF2alpha), a conserved translation initiation factor, is clock controlled in Neurospora crassa, peaking during the subjective day. Cycling P-eIF2alpha levels required rhythmic activation of the eIF2alpha kinase CPC-3 (the homolog of yeast and mammalian GCN2), and rhythmic activation of CPC-3 was abolished under conditions in which the levels of charged tRNAs were altered. Clock-controlled accumulation of P-eIF2alpha led to reduced translation during the day in vitro and was necessary for the rhythmic synthesis of select proteins in vivo. Finally, loss of rhythmic P-eIF2alpha levels led to reduced linear growth rates, supporting the idea that partitioning translation to specific times of day provides a growth advantage to the organism. Together, these results reveal a fundamental mechanism by which the clock regulates rhythmic protein production, and provide key insights into how rhythmic translation, cellular energy, stress, and nutrient metabolism are linked through the levels of charged versus uncharged tRNAs.","['Neurospora crassa', 'circadian clock', 'cpc-3', 'eIF2alpha', 'translation initiation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,TX 77843,2020 May 19
35196787,Coordinated Regulation of Membrane Homeostasis and Drug Accumulation by Novel Kinase STK-17 in Response to Antifungal Azole Treatment.,"The emergence of antifungal resistance, especially to the most widely used azole class of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, makes fungal infections difficult to treat in clinics and agriculture. When exposed to azoles, fungi can make adaptive responses to alleviate azole toxicity and produce azole tolerance. However, except for azole efflux pumps and ergosterol biosynthesis genes, the role of most azole responsive genes in azole resistance is unknown. In this study, STK-17, whose transcription is upregulated by azoles, was characterized as a novel kinase that is required for azole resistance. Deletion or dysfunction of STK-17 led to azole hypersensitivity in Neurospora crassa and to other ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors such as amorolfine, terbinafine, and amphotericin B, but not fatty acid and ceramide biosynthesis inhibitors. STK-17 was also required for oxidative stress resistance, but this was not connected to azole resistance. RNA-seq results showed that stk-17 deletion affected the basal expression and the response to ketoconazole of some membrane protein genes, indicating functional association of STK-17 with the membrane. Notably, deletion of stk-17 affected the normal response to azoles of erg genes, including the azole target-encoding gene erg11, and erg2, erg6, and erg24, and led to abnormal accumulation of sterols in the presence of azoles. HPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed increased intracellular azole accumulation in the stk-17 mutant, possibly due to enhanced azole influx and reduced azole efflux that was independent of the major efflux pump CDR4. Importantly, STK-17 was widely distributed and functionally conserved among fungi, thus providing a potential antifungal target. IMPORTANCE Antifungal resistance is increasing worldwide, especially to the most widely used azole class of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, making control of fungal infections more challenging. A lot of effort has been expended in elucidating the mechanism of azole resistance and revealing potential antifungal targets. In this study, by analyzing azole-responsive genes in Neurospora crassa, we discovered STK-17, a novel kinase, that is required for azole resistance in several types of fungi. It has a role in regulating membrane homeostasis, responses to azole by ergosterol biosynthesis genes and azole accumulation, thus, deepening our understanding on the mechanism of azole stress response. Additionally, STK-17 is conserved among fungi and plays important roles in fungal development and stress resistance. Kinase inhibitors are broadly used for treating diseases, and our study pinpoints a potential drug target for antifungal development.","['Fusarium verticilioides', 'Neurospora crassa', 'STK-17', 'azole accumulation', 'azole resistance', 'kinase', 'sterol biosynthesis']",Microbiology spectrum,China,2022 Feb 23

After four rounds of directed evolution using two different strategies, we obtained an AN25 mutant AN25-R4.18 with 43-fold improvement in terms of xylose transportation capacity while maintaining its high xylose specificity. In addition, glucose inhibition was almost completely eliminated in the final evolved mutant. We demonstrated that improved xylose transportation of AN25 mutants in the exponential growth phase led to significant improvement of xylose consumption in high cell-density fermentation. Finally, we showed that AN25 mutant AN25-R4.18 can enable relatively efficient glucose-xylose co-utilization in high concentrations of mixed sugars.","['directed evolution', 'glucose-xylose co-utilization', 'xylose specific transporter']",Biotechnology and bioengineering,61801,2016 Mar
23958634,CATP is a critical component of the Neurospora circadian clock by regulating the nucleosome occupancy rhythm at the frequency locus.,"Rhythmic frq transcription is essential for the function of the Neurospora circadian clock. Here we show that there is a circadian histone occupancy rhythm at the frq promoter that is regulated by FREQUENCY (FRQ). Using a combination of forward genetics and genome sequencing, we identify Clock ATPase (CATP) as an essential clock component. Our results demonstrate that CATP associates with the frq locus and other WCC target genes and promotes histone removal at these loci to allow circadian gene transcription. These results indicate that the rhythmic control of histone occupancy at clock genes is critical for circadian clock function.",?,EMBO reports,USA,2013 Oct
32503980,Spitzenkorper assembly mechanisms reveal conserved features of fungal and metazoan polarity scaffolds.,"The Spitzenkorper (SPK) constitutes a collection of secretory vesicles and polarity-related proteins intimately associated with polarized growth of fungal hyphae. Many SPK-localized proteins are known, but their assembly and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we identify protein-protein interaction cascades leading to assembly of two SPK scaffolds and recruitment of diverse effectors in Neurospora crassa. Both scaffolds are transported to the SPK by the myosin V motor (MYO-5), with the coiled-coil protein SPZ-1 acting as cargo adaptor. Neither scaffold appears to be required for accumulation of SPK secretory vesicles. One scaffold consists of Leashin-2 (LAH-2), which is required for SPK localization of the signalling kinase COT-1 and the glycolysis enzyme GPI-1. The other scaffold comprises a complex of Janus-1 (JNS-1) and the polarisome protein SPA-2. Via its Spa homology domain (SHD), SPA-2 recruits a calponin domain-containing F-actin effector (CCP-1). The SHD NMR structure reveals a conserved surface groove required for effector binding. Similarities between SPA-2/JNS-1 and the metazoan GIT/PIX complex identify foundational features of the cell polarity apparatus that predate the fungal-metazoan divergence.",?,Nature communications,Singapore,2020 Jun 5
25688421,Experimental demonstration of the benefits of somatic fusion and the consequences for allorecognition.,"Allorecognition, the ability to distinguish ""self"" from ""nonself"" based on allelic differences at allorecognition loci, is common in all domains of life. Allorecognition restricts the opportunities for social parasitism, and is therefore crucial for the evolution of cooperation. However, the maintenance of allorecognition diversity provides a paradox. If allorecognition is costly relative to cooperation, common alleles will be favored. Thus, the cost of allorecognition may reduce the genetic variation upon which allorecognition crucially relies, a prediction now known as ""Crozier's paradox."" We establish the relative costs of allorecognition, and their consequences for the short-term evolution of recognition labels theoretically predicted by Crozier. We use fusion among colonies of the fungus Neurospora crassa, regulated by highly variable allorecognition genes, as an experimental model system. We demonstrate that fusion among colonies is mutually beneficial, relative to absence of fusion upon allorecognition. This benefit is due not only to absence of mutual antagonism, which occurs upon allorecognition, but also to an increase in colony size per se. We then experimentally demonstrate that the benefit of fusion selects against allorecognition diversity, as predicted by Crozier. We discuss what maintains allorecognition diversity.","['Ascomycete fungi', 'heterokaryon incompatibility', 'kin selection', 'multicellularity', 'social evolution']",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,The Netherlands. eric.bastiaans@wur.nl,2015 Apr
31950228,Drought-Induced Stress Priming in Two Distinct Filamentous Saprotrophic Fungi.,"Sessile organisms constantly face environmental fluctuations and especially drought is a common stressor. One adaptive mechanism is ""stress priming,"" the ability to cope with a severe stress (""triggering"") by retaining information from a previous mild stress event (""priming""). While plants have been extensively investigated for drought-induced stress priming, no information is available for saprotrophic filamentous fungi, which are highly important for nutrient cycles. Here, we investigated the potential for drought-induced stress priming of one strain each of two ubiquitous species, Neurospora crassa and Penicillium chrysogenum. A batch experiment with 4 treatments was conducted on a sandy soil: exposure to priming and/or triggering as well as non-stressed controls. A priming stress was caused by desiccation to pF 4. The samples were then rewetted and after 1-, 7-, or 14-days of recovery triggered (pF 6). After triggering, fungal biomass, respiration, and beta-glucosidase activity were quantified. P. chrysogenum showed positive stress priming effects. After 1 day of recovery, biomass as well as beta-glucosidase activity and respiration were 0.5 to 5 times higher during triggering. Effects on biomass and activity decreased with prolonged recovery but lasted for 7 days and minor effects were still detectable after 14 days. Without triggering, stress priming had a temporary negative impact on biomass but this reversed after 14 days. For N. crassa, no stress priming effect was observed on the tested variables. The potential for drought-induced stress priming seems to be species specific with potentially high impact on composition and activity of fungal communities considering the expected increase of drought events.","['Drought stress', 'Saprotrophic filamentous fungi', 'Stress memory', 'Stress priming']",Microbial ecology,Germany. alexander.guhr@uni-bayreuth.de,2020 Jul
27425220,Identification and functional analysis of endogenous nitric oxide in a filamentous fungus.,"In spite of its prevalence in animals and plants, endogenous nitric oxide (NO) has been rarely reported in fungi. We present here our observations on production of intracellular NO and its possible roles during development of Neurospora crassa, a model filamentous fungus. Intracellular NO was detected in hypha 8-16 hours after incubation in Vogel's minimal liquid media and conidiophores during conidiation using a fluorescent indicator (DAF-FM diacetate). Treatment with cPTIO, an NO scavenger, significantly reduced fluorescence levels and hindered hyphal growth in liquid media and conidiation, whereas exogenous NO enhanced hyphal extension on VM agar media and conidia formation. NO scavenging also dramatically diminished transcription of con-10 and con-13, genes preferentially expressed during conidiation. Our results suggest that intracellular NO is generated in young hypha growing in submerged culture and during conidia development and regulate mycelial development and conidia formation.",?,Scientific reports,Republic of Korea,2016 Jul 18
25635104,Circadian rhythms. Decoupling circadian clock protein turnover from circadian period determination.,"The mechanistic basis of eukaryotic circadian oscillators in model systems as diverse as Neurospora, Drosophila, and mammalian cells is thought to be a transcription-and-translation-based negative feedback loop, wherein progressive and controlled phosphorylation of one or more negative elements ultimately elicits their own proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby releasing negative feedback and determining circadian period length. The Neurospora crassa circadian negative element FREQUENCY (FRQ) exemplifies such proteins; it is progressively phosphorylated at more than 100 sites, and strains bearing alleles of frq with anomalous phosphorylation display abnormal stability of FRQ that is well correlated with altered periods or apparent arrhythmicity. Unexpectedly, we unveiled normal circadian oscillations that reflect the allelic state of frq but that persist in the absence of typical degradation of FRQ. This manifest uncoupling of negative element turnover from circadian period length determination is not consistent with the consensus eukaryotic circadian model.",?,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",USA. jay.c.dunlap@dartmouth.edu llarrondo@bio.puc.cl,2015 Jan 30
31739777,Synthetic control devices for gene regulation in Penicillium chrysogenum.,"BACKGROUND: Orthogonal, synthetic control devices were developed for Penicillium chrysogenum, a model filamentous fungus and industrially relevant cell factory. In the synthetic transcription factor, the QF DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor of the quinic acid gene cluster of Neurospora crassa is fused to the VP16 activation domain. This synthetic transcription factor controls the expression of genes under a synthetic promoter containing quinic acid upstream activating sequence (QUAS) elements, where it binds. A gene cluster may demand an expression tuned individually for each gene, which is a great advantage provided by this system. RESULTS: The control devices were characterized with respect to three of their main components: expression of the synthetic transcription factors, upstream activating sequences, and the affinity of the DNA binding domain of the transcription factor to the upstream activating domain. This resulted in synthetic expression devices, with an expression ranging from hardly detectable to a level similar to that of highest expressed native genes. The versatility of the control device was demonstrated by fluorescent reporters and its application was confirmed by synthetically controlling the production of penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of the control devices in microbioreactors, proved to give excellent indications for how the devices function in production strains and conditions. We anticipate that these well-characterized and robustly performing control devices can be widely applied for the production of secondary metabolites and other compounds in filamentous fungi.","['Gene regulation', 'Hybrid transcription factor', 'Penicillium chrysogenum', 'Secondary metabolite production', 'Synthetic expression system', 'Synthetic gene cluster']",Microbial cell factories,The Netherlands,2019 Nov 18
36721877,An evolutionarily conserved mechanism underlies interspecies cell-cell signalling in fungi.,"When a conidium (vegetative spore) or ascospore (sexually produced spore) of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa germinates, it produces a long narrow filamentous multinucleate cell called a hypha. Hyphae grow by elongation, they can branch, and the tips of branches can also rejoin by fusion. Growth, branching, and fusion create an interconnected web, called a mycelium, within which cytoplasmic continuity is maintained. Some researchers have focused their studies on hyphal elongation and branching, others on formation of conidia and ascospores, and still others, prominently Andre Fleissner, Nick Read, Louise Glass, and colleagues, on tip fusion. Each of these fundamental processes contributes to the development of species-characteristic mycelial morphology. Using the fluorescently tagged Neurospora proteins MAK-2 and SO, they made the startling discovery that when tips of freshly germinated and genetically identical conidia (germlings) came within 15 mum of each other, each tip took turns to send and receive a molecular signal in an oscillatory back-and-forth manner.",?,Journal of biosciences,Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics,2023
25647728,Expanding xylose metabolism in yeast for plant cell wall conversion to biofuels.,"Sustainable biofuel production from renewable biomass will require the efficient and complete use of all abundant sugars in the plant cell wall. Using the cellulolytic fungus Neurospora crassa as a model, we identified a xylodextrin transport and consumption pathway required for its growth on hemicellulose. Reconstitution of this xylodextrin utilization pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that fungal xylose reductases act as xylodextrin reductases, producing xylosyl-xylitol oligomers as metabolic intermediates. These xylosyl-xylitol intermediates are generated by diverse fungi and bacteria, indicating that xylodextrin reduction is widespread in nature. Xylodextrins and xylosyl-xylitol oligomers are then hydrolyzed by two hydrolases to generate intracellular xylose and xylitol. Xylodextrin consumption using a xylodextrin transporter, xylodextrin reductases and tandem intracellular hydrolases in cofermentations with sucrose and glucose greatly expands the capacity of yeast to use plant cell wall-derived sugars and has the potential to increase the efficiency of both first-generation and next-generation biofuel production.","['B. subtilis', 'E. coli', 'N. crassa', 'S. cerevisiae', 'biofuel', 'cofermentation', 'computational biology', 'ecology', 'hemicellulose', 'systems biology', 'xylodextrin', 'xylose', 'xylosyl-xylitol']",eLife,United States,2015 Feb 3
27259000,Cell wall composition plays a key role on sensitivity of filamentous fungi to chitosan.,"Chitosan antifungal activity has been reported for both filamentous fungi and yeast. Previous studies have shown fungal plasma membrane as main chitosan target. However, the role of the fungal cell wall (CW) in their response to chitosan is unknown. We show that cell wall regeneration in Neurospora crassa (chitosan sensitive) protoplasts protects them from chitosan damage. Caspofungin, a beta-1,3-glucan synthase inhibitor, showed a synergistic antifungal effect with chitosan for N. crassa but not for Pochonia chlamydosporia, a biocontrol fungus resistant to chitosan. Chitosan significantly repressed N. crassa genes involved in beta-1,3-glucan synthesis (fks) and elongation (gel-1) but the chitin synthase gene (chs-1) did not present changes in its expression. N. crassa cell wall deletion strains related to beta-1,3-glucan elongation (Deltagel-1 and Deltagel-2) were more sensitive to chitosan than wild type (wt). On the contrary, chitin synthase deletion strain (Deltachs-1) showed the same sensitivity to chitosan than wt. The mycelium of P. chlamydosporia showed a higher (ca. twofold) beta-1,3-glucan/chitin ratio than that of N. crassa. Taken together, our results indicate that cell wall composition plays an important role on -sensitivity of filamentous fungi to chitosan.","['Antifungal', 'Caspofungin', 'Chitosan', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Pochonia chlamydosporia']",Journal of basic microbiology,Spain. almudena.aranda@ua.es,2016 Oct
29923150,Protein Production Through Microbial Conversion of Rice Straw by Multi-Strain Fermentation.,"Multi-strain mixed fermentation can provide a relatively complete lignocellulosic enzyme system compared with single-strain fermentation. This study was firstly to screen strains which have a strong ability to hydrolyse rice straw (RS) enzymatically and enrich true protein (TP). Then, the conditions in the process of SSF, including the optimum inoculum size of mixed strains, inoculation ratio, and different inoculation time of N. crassa 14-8, were optimized. The experimental results showed that the highest TP content could be obtained by using N. crassa 14-8, C. utilis, and P. chrysosporium as mixed strains, and 5 mM Mn(2+) and 50 mM veratryl alcohol were used as inducers of lignin peroxidase (LiP) to improve the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. When N. crassa 14-8 was inoculated 1 day later than P. chrysosporium, the total inoculum size was 10%, and the optimum ratio of N. crassa 14-8 to P. chrysosporium was 1:2, the maximum TP yield (8.89%) was obtained, with 123.37% of its increase rate.

26781458,De-repression of CSP-1 activates adaptive responses to antifungal azoles.,"Antifungal azoles are the major drugs that are used to treat fungal infections. This study found that in response to antifungal azole stress, Neurospora crassa could activate the transcriptional responses of many genes and increase azole resistance by reducing the level of conidial separation 1 (CSP-1), a global transcription repressor, at azole-responsive genes. The expression of csp-1 was directly activated by the transcription factors WC-1 and WC-2. Upon ketoconazole (KTC) stress, the transcript levels of wc-1 and wc-2 were not changed, but csp-1 transcription rapidly declined. A chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed a rapid reduction in the WC-2 enrichment at the csp-1 promoter upon KTC treatment, which might be responsible for the KTC-induced csp-1 downregulation. Deletion of csp-1 increased resistance to KTC and voriconazole, while csp-1 overexpression increased KTC susceptibility. CSP-1 transcriptionally repressed a number of azole-responsive genes, including genes encoding the azole target ERG11, the azole efflux pump CDR4, and the sterol C-22 desaturase ERG5. Deletion of csp-1 also reduced the KTC-induced accumulation of ergosterol intermediates, eburicol, and 14alpha-methyl-3,6-diol.

24030828,The Ccr4-not protein complex regulates the phase of the Neurospora circadian clock by controlling white collar protein stability and activity.,"In the Neurospora circadian negative feedback loop, white collar 1 (WC-1) and WC-2 form the WC complex that activates frequency (frq) transcription. Here we show that Not1 is a WC-interacting protein and is important for maintaining WC levels. The not1 transcript displays a circadian oscillation with a similar phase as frq. Down-regulation of not1 leads to low levels of WC-1 and WC-2 and a delayed circadian phase as a result of increased protein degradation and increased WC activity. Protein purification of Not1 shows that it is part of the Neurospora Ccr4-Not complex. ccr4 is a clock-controlled gene and is regulated directly by the WC complex. Down-regulation of ccr4 results in a phase delay and period lengthening of the clock. Together, our findings suggest that the Ccr4-Not complex participates in the Neurospora clock function by interacting with and regulating the WC complex.","['Circadian Clock', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Neurospora', 'Photobiology', 'Transcription']",The Journal of biological chemistry,China,2013 Oct 25

Although VVD has several advantages over other photoreceptors as photoinducible homodimerization system, VVD has a critical limitation in its low dimer-forming efficiency. To overcome this limitation of wild-type VVD, here we conduct site-directed saturation mutagenesis in the homodimer interface of VVD. We have found that the Ile52Cys mutation of VVD (VVD-52C) substantially improves its homodimer-forming efficiency up to 180%. We have demonstrated the utility of VVD-52C for making a light-inducible gene expression system more robust. In addition, using VVD-52C, we have developed photoactivatable caspase-9, which enables optical control of apoptosis of mammalian cells.

31835532,Influence of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase Active Site Segments on Activity and Affinity.,"In past years, new lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) have been discovered as distinct in their substrate specificity. Their unconventional, surface-exposed catalytic sites determine their enzymatic activities, while binding sites govern substrate recognition and regioselectivity. An additional factor influencing activity is the presence or absence of a family 1 carbohydrate binding module (CBM1) connected via a linker to the C-terminus of the LPMO. This study investigates the changes in activity induced by shortening the second active site segment (Seg2) or removing the CBM1 from Neurospora crassa LPMO9C. NcLPMO9C and generated variants have been tested on regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and xyloglucan (XG) using activity assays, conversion experiments and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The absence of CBM1 reduced the binding affinity and activity of NcLPMO9C, but did not affect its regioselectivity. The linker was found important for the thermal stability of NcLPMO9C and the CBM1 is necessary for efficient binding to RAC. Wild-type NcLPMO9C exhibited the highest activity and strongest substrate binding. Shortening of Seg2 greatly reduced the activity on RAC and CMC and completely abolished the activity on XG. This demonstrates that Seg2 is indispensable for substrate recognition and the formation of productive enzyme-substrate complexes.","['enzyme engineering', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'phylogenetic analysis', 'regioselectivity', 'substrate binding', 'substrate specificity']",International journal of molecular sciences,Austria,2019 Dec 10
29592970,Spatio-temporal MAPK dynamics mediate cell behavior coordination during fungal somatic cell fusion.,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are conserved regulators of proliferation, differentiation and adaptation in eukaryotic cells. Their activity often involves changes in their subcellular localization, indicating an important role for these spatio-temporal dynamics in signal transmission. A striking model illustrating these dynamics is somatic cell fusion in Neurospora crassa Germinating spores of this fungus rapidly alternate between signal sending and receiving, thereby establishing a cell-cell dialog, which involves the alternating membrane recruitment of the MAPK MAK-2 in both fusion partners. Here, we show that the dynamic translocation of MAK-2 is essential for coordinating the behavior of the fusion partners before physical contact. The activation and function of the kinase strongly correlate with its subcellular localization, indicating a crucial contribution of the MAPK dynamics in establishing regulatory feedback loops, which establish the oscillatory signaling mode. In addition, we provide evidence that MAK-2 not only contributes to cell-cell communication, but also mediates cell-cell fusion. The MAK-2 dynamics significantly differ between these two processes, suggesting a role for the MAPK in switching of the cellular program between communication and fusion.","['Cell communication', 'Cell fusion', 'Directed growth', 'MAPK']",Journal of cell science,Germany,2018 May 4
23589521,The transcriptional response to nonself in the fungus Podospora anserina.,"In fungi, heterokaryon incompatibility is a nonself recognition process occurring when filaments of different isolates of the same species fuse. Compatibility is controlled by so-called het loci and fusion of strains of unlike het genotype triggers a complex incompatibility reaction that leads to the death of the fusion cell. Herein, we analyze the transcriptional changes during the incompatibility reaction in Podospora anserina. The incompatibility response was found to be associated with a massive transcriptional reprogramming: 2231 genes were up-regulated by a factor 2 or more during incompatibility. In turn, 2441 genes were down-regulated. HET, NACHT, and HeLo domains previously found to be involved in the control of heterokaryon incompatibility were enriched in the up-regulated gene set. In addition, incompatibility was characterized by an up-regulation of proteolytic and other hydrolytic activities, of secondary metabolism clusters and toxins and effector-like proteins. The up-regulated set was found to be enriched for proteins lacking orthologs in other species and chromosomal distribution of the up-regulated genes was uneven with up-regulated genes residing preferentially in genomic islands and on chromosomes IV and V. There was a significant overlap between regulated genes during incompatibility in P. anserina and Neurospora crassa, indicating similarities in the incompatibility responses in these two species. Globally, this study illustrates that the expression changes occurring during cell fusion incompatibility in P. anserina are in several aspects reminiscent of those described in host-pathogen or symbiotic interactions in other fungal species.","['HET domain', 'Podospora anserina', 'STAND proteins', 'heterokaryon incompatibility', 'nonself recognition']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",France,2013 Jun 21
25861818,Parallel Structural Evolution of Mitochondrial Ribosomes and OXPHOS Complexes.,"The five macromolecular complexes that jointly mediate oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria consist of many more subunits than those of bacteria, yet, it remains unclear by which evolutionary mechanism(s) these novel subunits were recruited. Even less well understood is the structural evolution of mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes): while it was long thought that their exceptionally high protein content would physically compensate for their uniquely low amount of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), this hypothesis has been refuted by structural studies. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 73S mitoribosome from Neurospora crassa, together with genomic and proteomic analyses of mitoribosome composition across the eukaryotic domain. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that both structurally and compositionally, mitoribosomes have evolved very similarly to mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes via two distinct phases: A constructive phase that mainly acted early in eukaryote evolution, resulting in the recruitment of altogether approximately 75 novel subunits, and a reductive phase that acted during metazoan evolution, resulting in gradual length-reduction of mitochondrially encoded rRNAs and OXPHOS proteins. Both phases can be well explained by the accumulation of (slightly) deleterious mutations and deletions, respectively, in mitochondrially encoded rRNAs and OXPHOS proteins. We argue that the main role of the newly recruited (nuclear encoded) ribosomal- and OXPHOS proteins is to provide structural compensation to the mutationally destabilized mitochondrially encoded components. While the newly recruited proteins probably provide a selective advantage owing to their compensatory nature, and while their presence may have opened evolutionary pathways toward novel mitochondrion-specific functions, we emphasize that the initial events that resulted in their recruitment was nonadaptive in nature. Our framework is supported by population genetic studies, and it can explain the complete structural evolution of mitochondrial ribosomes and OXPHOS complexes, as well as many observed functions of individual proteins.","['cryo-electron microscopy', 'mitochondrial evolution', 'nonadaptive evolution', 'ribosome']",Genome biology and evolution,Germany vandersluis@lmb.uni-muenchen.de beckmann@lmb.uni-muenchen.de,2015 Apr 9
26109355,Endogenous Small RNA Mediates Meiotic Silencing of a Novel DNA Transposon.,"Genome defense likely evolved to curtail the spread of transposable elements and invading viruses. A combination of effective defense mechanisms has been shown to limit colonization of the Neurospora crassa genome by transposable elements. A novel DNA transposon named Sly1-1 was discovered in the genome of the most widely used laboratory ""wild-type"" strain FGSC 2489 (OR74A). Meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA, also simply called meiotic silencing, prevents the expression of regions of the genome that are unpaired during karyogamy. This mechanism is posttranscriptional and is proposed to involve the production of small RNA, so-called masiRNAs, by proteins homologous to those involved in RNA interference-silencing pathways in animals, fungi, and plants. Here, we demonstrate production of small RNAs when Sly1-1 was unpaired in a cross between two wild-type strains. These small RNAs are dependent on SAD-1, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase necessary for meiotic silencing. We present the first case of endogenously produced masiRNA from a novel N. crassa DNA transposable element.","['Neurospora', 'genome defense', 'meiotic silencing', 'small RNA', 'transposon']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",California 92521,2015 Jun 23
35166849,A-to-I mRNA editing controls spore death induced by a fungal meiotic drive gene in homologous and heterologous expression systems.,"Spore killers are meiotic drive elements that can block the development of sexual spores in fungi. In the maize ear rot and mycotoxin-producing fungus Fusarium verticillioides, a spore killer called SkK has been mapped to a 102-kb interval of chromosome V. Here, we show that a gene within this interval, SKC1, is required for SkK-mediated spore killing and meiotic drive. We also demonstrate that SKC1 is associated with at least 4 transcripts, 2 sense (sense-SKC1a and sense-SKC1b) and 2 antisense (antisense-SKC1a and antisense-SKC1b). Both antisense SKC1 transcripts lack obvious protein-coding sequences and thus appear to be noncoding RNAs. In contrast, sense-SKC1a is a protein-coding transcript that undergoes A-to-I editing to sense-SKC1b in sexual tissue. Translation of sense-SKC1a produces a 70-amino-acid protein (Skc1a), whereas the translation of sense-SKC1b produces an 84-amino-acid protein (Skc1b). Heterologous expression analysis of SKC1 transcripts shows that sense-SKC1a also undergoes A-to-I editing to sense-SKC1b during the Neurospora crassa sexual cycle. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that Skc1b is responsible for spore killing in Fusarium verticillioides and that it induces most meiotic cells to die in Neurospora crassa. Finally, we report that SKC1 homologs are present in over 20 Fusarium species. Overall, our results demonstrate that fungal meiotic drive elements like SKC1 can influence the outcome of meiosis by hijacking a cell's A-to-I editing machinery and that the involvement of A-to-I editing in a fungal meiotic drive system does not preclude its horizontal transfer to a distantly related species.","['Fusarium', 'Neurospora', 'SKC1', 'A-to-I editing', 'MSUD', 'RIP', 'fumonisins', 'gene drive', 'spore killer']",Genetics,USA,2022 May 5

Powdery mildew fungi are obligate biotrophic parasites unable to grow on culture media, a fact that has significantly limited their genetic manipulation. In this work, we report a protocol based on the electroporation of fungal conidia, for the transient transformation of Podosphaera fusca (synonym Podosphaera xanthii), the main causal agent of cucurbit powdery mildew. RESULTS: To introduce DNA into P. xanthii conidia, we applied two square-wave pulses of 1.7 kV for 1 ms with an interval of 5 s. We tested these conditions with several plasmids bearing as selective markers hygromycin B resistance (hph), carbendazim resistance (TUB2) or GFP (gfp) under control of endogenous regulatory elements from Aspergillus nidulans, Neurospora crassa or P. xanthii to drive their expression. An in planta selection procedure using the MBC fungicide carbendazim permitted the propagation of transformants onto zucchini cotyledons and avoided the phytotoxicity associated with hygromycin B. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the transformation of P. xanthii and the transformation of powdery mildew fungi using electroporation. Although the transformants are transient, this represents a feasible method for the genetic manipulation of this important group of plant pathogens.",?,BMC microbiology,Spain. dvela@uma.es,2015 Feb 6
34718697,An integrative NMR-SAXS approach for structural determination of large RNAs defines the substrate-free state of a trans-cleaving Neurospora Varkud Satellite ribozyme.,"The divide-and-conquer strategy is commonly used for protein structure determination, but its applications to high-resolution structure determination of RNAs have been limited. Here, we introduce an integrative approach based on the divide-and-conquer strategy that was undertaken to determine the solution structure of an RNA model system, the Neurospora VS ribozyme. NMR and SAXS studies were conducted on a minimal trans VS ribozyme as well as several isolated subdomains. A multi-step procedure was used for structure determination that first involved pairing refined NMR structures with SAXS data to obtain structural subensembles of the various subdomains. These subdomain structures were then assembled to build a large set of structural models of the ribozyme, which was subsequently filtered using SAXS data. The resulting NMR-SAXS structural ensemble shares several similarities with the reported crystal structures of the VS ribozyme. However, a local structural difference is observed that affects the global fold by shifting the relative orientation of the two three-way junctions. Thus, this finding highlights a global conformational change associated with substrate binding in the VS ribozyme that is likely critical for its enzymatic activity. Structural studies of other large RNAs should benefit from similar integrative approaches that allow conformational sampling of assembled fragments.",?,Nucleic acids research,Canada,2021 Nov 18
27506798,Circadian clock regulation of mRNA translation through eukaryotic elongation factor eEF-2.,"The circadian clock has a profound effect on gene regulation, controlling rhythmic transcript accumulation for up to half of expressed genes in eukaryotes. Evidence also exists for clock control of mRNA translation, but the extent and mechanisms for this regulation are not known. In Neurospora crassa, the circadian clock generates daily rhythms in the activation of conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways when cells are grown in constant conditions, including rhythmic activation of the well-characterized p38 osmosensing (OS) MAPK pathway. Rhythmic phosphorylation of the MAPK OS-2 (P-OS-2) leads to temporal control of downstream targets of OS-2. We show that osmotic stress in N. crassa induced the phosphorylation of a eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) kinase, radiation sensitivity complementing kinase-2 (RCK-2), and that RCK-2 is necessary for high-level phosphorylation of eEF-2, a key regulator of translation elongation. The levels of phosphorylated RCK-2 and phosphorylated eEF-2 cycle in abundance in wild-type cells but not in cells deleted for OS-2 or the core clock component FREQUENCY (FRQ). Translation extracts from cells grown in constant conditions show decreased translational activity in the late subjective morning, coincident with the peak in eEF-2 phosphorylation, and rhythmic translation of glutathione S-transferase (GST-3) from constitutive mRNA levels in vivo is dependent on circadian regulation of eEF-2 activity. In contrast, rhythms in phosphorylated eEF-2 levels are not necessary for rhythms in accumulation of the clock protein FRQ, indicating that clock control of eEF-2 activity promotes rhythmic translation of specific mRNAs.","['Neurospora crassa', 'circadian clock', 'eEF-2', 'translation', 'translation elongation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,TX 77843,2016 Aug 23
26254031,Analysis of Circadian Rhythms in the Basal Filamentous Ascomycete Pyronema confluens.,"Many organisms use circadian clocks to adapt to daily changes in the environment. Major insights into the molecular mechanisms of circadian oscillators have been gained through studies of the model organism Neurospora crassa; however, little is known about molecular components of circadian clocks in other fungi. An important part of the N. crassa circadian clock is the frequency (frq) gene, homologs of which can be found in Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Leotiomycetes, but not Eurotiomycetes. Recently, we identified a frq homolog in Pyronema confluens, a member of the early-diverging Pezizomycete lineage of filamentous ascomycetes. The P. confluens FRQ shares many conserved domains with the N. crassa FRQ. However, there is no known morphological phenotype showing overt circadian rhythmicity in P. confluens. To investigate whether a molecular clock is present, we analyzed frq transcription in constant darkness, and found circadian oscillation of frq with a peak in the subjective morning. This rhythm was temperature compensated. To identify additional clock-controlled genes, we performed RNA sequencing of two time points (subjective morning and evening). Circadian expression of two morning-specific genes was verified by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) over a full time course, whereas expression of two putative morning-specific and five putative evening-specific genes could not be verified as circadian. frq expression was synchronized, but not entrained by light. In summary, we have found evidence for two of the three main properties of circadian rhythms (free-running rhythm, temperature compensation) in P. confluens, suggesting that a circadian clock with rhythmically expressed frq is present in this basal filamentous ascomycete.","['Pyronema confluens', 'circadian clock', 'clock-controlled genes', 'frequency', 'light-entrainment']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Germany,2015 Aug 7
25848091,Role for Protein Kinase A in the Neurospora Circadian Clock by Regulating White Collar-Independent frequency Transcription through Phosphorylation of RCM-1.,"Rhythmic activation and repression of clock gene expression is essential for the eukaryotic circadian clock functions. In the Neurospora circadian oscillator, the transcription of the frequency (frq) gene is periodically activated by the White Collar (WC) complex and suppressed by the FRQ-FRH complex. We previously showed that there is WC-independent frq transcription and its repression is required for circadian gene expression. How WC-independent frq transcription is regulated is not known. We show here that elevated protein kinase A (PKA) activity results in WC-independent frq transcription and the loss of clock function. We identified RCM-1 as the protein partner of RCO-1 and an essential component of the clock through its role in suppressing WC-independent frq transcription. RCM-1 is a phosphoprotein and is a substrate of PKA in vivo and in vitro. Mutation of the PKA-dependent phosphorylation sites on RCM-1 results in WC-independent transcription of frq and impaired clock function. Furthermore, we showed that RCM-1 is associated with the chromatin at the frq locus, a process that is inhibited by PKA. Together, our results demonstrate that PKA regulates frq transcription by inhibiting RCM-1 activity through RCM-1 phosphorylation.",?,Molecular and cellular biology,China,2015 Jun

28403234,Transcriptional repression of frequency by the IEC-1-INO80 complex is required for normal Neurospora circadian clock function.,"Rhythmic activation and repression of the frequency (frq) gene are essential for normal function of the Neurospora circadian clock. WHITE COLLAR (WC) complex, the positive element of the Neurospora circadian system, is responsible for stimulation of frq transcription. We report that a C2H2 finger domain-containing protein IEC-1 and its associated chromatin remodeling complex INO80 play important roles in normal Neurospora circadian clock function. In iec-1KO strains, circadian rhythms are abolished, and the frq transcript levels are increased compared to that of the wild-type strain. Similar results are observed in mutant strains of the INO80 subunits. Furthermore, ChIP data show that recruitment of the INO80 complex to the frq promoter is IEC-1-dependent. WC-mediated transcription of frq contributes to the rhythmic binding of the INO80 complex at the frq promoter. As demonstrated by ChIP analysis, the INO80 complex is required for the re-establishment of the dense chromatin environment at the frq promoter. In addition, WC-independent frq transcription is present in ino80 mutants. Altogether, our data indicate that the INO80 complex suppresses frq transcription by re-assembling the suppressive mechanisms at the frq promoter after transcription of frq.",?,PLoS genetics,China,2017 Apr
27139112,Experimental evolution reveals that high relatedness protects multicellular cooperation from cheaters.,"In multicellular organisms, there is a potential risk that cheating mutants gain access to the germline. Development from a single-celled zygote resets relatedness among cells to its maximum value each generation, which should accomplish segregation of cheating mutants from non-cheaters and thereby protect multicellular cooperation. Here we provide the crucial direct comparison between high- and low-relatedness conditions to test this hypothesis. We allow two variants of the fungus Neurospora crassa to evolve, one with and one without the ability to form chimeras with other individuals, thus generating two relatedness levels. While multicellular cooperation remains high in the high-relatedness lines, it significantly decreases in all replicate low-relatedness lines, resulting in an average threefold decrease in spore yield. This reduction is caused by cheating mutants with reduced investment in somatic functions, but increased competitive success when fusing with non-cheaters. Our experiments demonstrate that high genetic relatedness is crucial to sustain multicellular cooperation.",?,Nature communications,The Netherlands,2016 May 3
33262215,ATP utilization by a DEAD-box protein during refolding of a misfolded group I intron ribozyme.,"DEAD-box helicase proteins perform ATP-dependent rearrangements of structured RNAs throughout RNA biology. Short RNA helices are unwound in a single ATPase cycle, but the ATP requirement for more complex RNA structural rearrangements is unknown. Here we measure the amount of ATP used for native refolding of a misfolded group I intron ribozyme by CYT-19, a Neurospora crassa DEAD-box protein that functions as a general chaperone for mitochondrial group I introns. By comparing the rates of ATP hydrolysis and ribozyme refolding, we find that several hundred ATP molecules are hydrolyzed during refolding of each ribozyme molecule. After subtracting nonproductive ATP hydrolysis that occurs in the absence of ribozyme refolding, we find that approximately 100 ATPs are hydrolyzed per refolded RNA as a consequence of interactions specific to the misfolded ribozyme. This value is insensitive to changes in ATP and CYT-19 concentration and decreases with decreasing ribozyme stability. Because of earlier findings that  approximately 90% of global ribozyme unfolding cycles lead back to the kinetically preferred misfolded conformation and are not observed, we estimate that each global unfolding cycle consumes  approximately 10 ATPs. Our results indicate that CYT-19 functions as a general RNA chaperone by using a stochastic, energy-intensive mechanism to promote RNA unfolding and refolding, suggesting an evolutionary convergence with protein chaperones.","['ATP', 'DEAD-box protein', 'RNA', 'RNA folding', 'RNA helicase', 'molecular chaperone', 'nucleic acid structure', 'ribozyme']",The Journal of biological chemistry,USA,2021 Jan-Jun
30471697,Characterizing Time-of-Day Conformational Changes in the Intrinsically Disordered Proteins of the Circadian Clock.,"Circadian rhythms are 24-h oscillations conserved in nearly all living organisms that allow for the anticipation of daily environmental changes. These rhythms are maintained by a molecular clock comprised of a transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop. Many of the proteins that organize this feedback loop are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which lack a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure. Little is known about the impact of intrinsic disorder in clock proteins and this lack of comprehension is compounded by the fact that sophisticated techniques to understand the inherent nature of IDPs are only now emerging. Here, we add to that conversation by describing our novel protocol to track the conformation of a core clock protein (FREQUENCY) in a vital clock model organism (Neurospora crassa). Our protocol, CiRcadian nAtive FasT parallel proteolYsis (CRAFTY), utilizes a parallel proteolysis approach in native conditions to determine the conformational shifts in FREQUENCY over time, providing biologically relevant information and contributing to our understanding of the importance of disorder in the circadian clock.","['CRAFTY', 'Circadian clock', 'FREQUENCY', 'Intrinsically disordered proteins', 'Limited digestion', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Proteolysis']",Methods in enzymology,United States,2018
31068130,Histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase is required for facultative heterochromatin at specific loci.,"BACKGROUND: Histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) are widely perceived to be opposing and often mutually exclusive chromatin modifications. However, both are needed for certain light-activated genes in Neurospora crassa (Neurospora), including frequency (frq) and vivid (vvd). Except for these 2 loci, little is known about how H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 impact and contribute to light-regulated gene expression. RESULTS: In this report, we performed a multi-dimensional genomic analysis to understand the role of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 using the Neurospora light response as the system. RNA-seq on strains lacking H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase (KMT2/SET-1) and histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase (KMT1/DIM-5) revealed some light-activated genes had altered expression, but the light response was largely intact. Comparing these 2 mutants to wild-type (WT), we found that roughly equal numbers of genes showed elevated and reduced expression in the dark and the light making the environmental stimulus somewhat ancillary to the genome-wide effects. ChIP-seq experiments revealed H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 had only minor changes in response to light in WT, but there were notable alterations in H3K4me3 in Deltakmt1/Deltadim-5 and H3K9me3 in Deltakmt2/Deltaset-1 indicating crosstalk and redistribution between the modifications. Integrated analysis of the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq highlighted context-dependent roles for KMT2/SET1 and KMT1/DIM-5 as either co-activators or co-repressors with some overlap as co-regulators. At a small subset of loci, H3K4 methylation is required for H3K9me3-mediated facultative heterochromatin including, the central clock gene frequency (frq). Finally, we used sequential ChIP (re-ChIP) experiment to confirm Neurospora contains K4/K9 bivalent domains. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate there are obfuscated regulatory roles for H3K4 methylation and H3K9 methylation depending on genome location with some minor overlap and co-dependency.","['Heterochromatin', 'Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation', 'Histone H3 lysine 9 methylation', 'Histone lysine methyltransferase', 'Light-activated gene expression', 'Long non-coding RNA']",BMC genomics,USA,2019 May 8
26711258,Alternative Use of DNA Binding Domains by the Neurospora White Collar Complex Dictates Circadian Regulation and Light Responses.,"In the Neurospora circadian system, the White Collar complex (WCC) of WC-1 and WC-2 drives transcription of the circadian pacemaker gene frequency (frq), whose gene product, FRQ, as a part of the FRQ-FRH complex (FFC), inhibits its own expression. The WCC is also the principal Neurospora photoreceptor; WCC-mediated light induction of frq resets the clock, and all acute light induction is triggered by WCC binding to promoters of light-induced genes. However, not all acutely light-induced genes are also clock regulated, and conversely, not all clock-regulated direct targets of WCC are light induced; the structural determinants governing the shift from WCC's dark circadian role to its light activation role are poorly described. We report that the DBD region (named for being defective in binding DNA), a basic region in WC-1 proximal to the DNA-binding zinc finger (ZnF) whose function was previously ascribed to nuclear localization, instead plays multiple essential roles assisting in DNA binding and mediating interactions with the FFC. DNA binding for light induction by the WCC requires only WC-2, whereas DNA binding for circadian functions requires WC-2 as well as the ZnF and DBD motif of WC-1. The data suggest a means by which alterations in the tertiary and quaternary structures of the WCC can lead to its distinct functions in the dark and in the light.",?,Molecular and cellular biology,USA,2015 Dec 28
34339411,Circadian rhythm shows potential for mRNA efficiency and self-organized division of labor in multinucleate cells.,"Multinucleate cells occur in every biosphere and across the kingdoms of life, including in the human body as muscle cells and bone-forming cells. Data from filamentous fungi suggest that, even when bathed in a common cytoplasm, nuclei are capable of autonomous behaviors, including division. How does this potential for autonomy affect the organization of cellular processes between nuclei? Here we analyze a simplified model of circadian rhythm, a form of cellular oscillator, in a mathematical model of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Our results highlight a potential role played by mRNA-protein phase separation to keep mRNAs close to the nuclei from which they originate, while allowing proteins to diffuse freely between nuclei. Our modeling shows that syncytism allows for extreme mRNA efficiency-we demonstrate assembly of a robust oscillator with a transcription rate a thousand-fold less than in comparable uninucleate cells. We also show self-organized division of the labor of mRNA production, with one nucleus in a two-nucleus syncytium producing at least twice as many mRNAs as the other in 30% of cycles. This division can occur spontaneously, but division of labor can also be controlled by regulating the amount of cytoplasmic volume available to each nucleus. Taken together, our results show the intriguing richness and potential for emergent organization among nuclei in multinucleate cells. They also highlight the role of previously studied mechanisms of cellular organization, including nuclear space control and localization of mRNAs through RNA-protein phase separation, in regulating nuclear coordination.",?,PLoS computational biology,United States of America,2021 Aug
28667016,An RNA Recognition Motif-Containing Protein Functions in Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA.,"Meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD) is a biological process that searches pairs of homologous chromosomes (homologs) for segments of DNA that are unpaired. Genes found within unpaired segments are silenced for the duration of meiosis. In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of Neurospora crassa sad-7, a gene that encodes a protein with an RNA recognition motif (RRM). Orthologs of sad-7 are found in a wide range of ascomycete fungi. In N. crassa, sad-7 is required for a fully efficient MSUD response to unpaired genes. Additionally, at least one parent must have a functional sad-7 allele for a cross to produce ascospores. Although sad-7-null crosses are barren, sad-7(Delta) strains grow at a wild-type (wt) rate and appear normal under vegetative growth conditions. With respect to expression, sad-7 is transcribed at baseline levels in early vegetative cultures, at slightly higher levels in mating-competent cultures, and is at its highest level during mating. These findings suggest that SAD-7 is specific to mating-competent and sexual cultures. Although the role of SAD-7 in MSUD remains elusive, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based tagging studies place SAD-7 within nuclei, perinuclear regions, and cytoplasmic foci of meiotic cells. This localization pattern is unique among known MSUD proteins and raises the possibility that SAD-7 coordinates nuclear, perinuclear, and cytoplasmic aspects of MSUD.","['RNA silencing', 'RRM domain', 'chromosome pairing', 'homology search', 'meiosis']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Illinois 61790,2017 Aug 7
34168079,The F-box protein gene exo-1 is a target for reverse engineering enzyme hypersecretion in filamentous fungi.,"Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) are vital for the lignocellulose-based biorefinery. The development of hypersecreting fungal protein production hosts is therefore a major aim for both academia and industry. However, despite advances in our understanding of their regulation, the number of promising candidate genes for targeted strain engineering remains limited. Here, we resequenced the genome of the classical hypersecreting Neurospora crassa mutant exo-1 and identified the causative point of mutation to reside in the F-box protein-encoding gene, NCU09899. The corresponding deletion strain displayed amylase and invertase activities exceeding those of the carbon catabolite derepressed strain Deltacre-1, while glucose repression was still mostly functional in Deltaexo-1 Surprisingly, RNA sequencing revealed that while plant cell wall degradation genes are broadly misexpressed in Deltaexo-1, only a small fraction of CAZyme genes and sugar transporters are up-regulated, indicating that EXO-1 affects specific regulatory factors. Aiming to elucidate the underlying mechanism of enzyme hypersecretion, we found the high secretion of amylases and invertase in Deltaexo-1 to be completely dependent on the transcriptional regulator COL-26. Furthermore, misregulation of COL-26, CRE-1, and cellular carbon and nitrogen metabolism was confirmed by proteomics. Finally, we successfully transferred the hypersecretion trait of the exo-1 disruption by reverse engineering into the industrially deployed fungus Myceliophthora thermophila using CRISPR-Cas9. Our identification of an important F-box protein demonstrates the strength of classical mutants combined with next-generation sequencing to uncover unanticipated candidates for engineering. These data contribute to a more complete understanding of CAZyme regulation and will facilitate targeted engineering of hypersecretion in further organisms of interest.","['CAZyme gene regulation', 'F-box proteins', 'Neurospora crassa', 'enzyme hypersecretion', 'fungal biotechnology']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CA 94608,2021 Jun 29
23966547,Evolutionary dynamics of sex-biased genes in a hermaphrodite fungus.,"Differential gene expression is believed to largely explain sexually dichotomous phenotypes. This phenomenon is especially significant in hermaphrodites, in which male and female sexual tissues have identical genotypes. Sex differences in transcription have been linked to molecular evolution: genes with higher expression in male compared with female sexual tissues (i.e., male-biased genes) have been associated with rapid gene divergence in various animals and plants, implying that selective differences exist among the sexual structures. In the present investigation, we examined expressed sequence tags, microarrays, and gene sequence data from the hermaphroditic fungus Neurospora crassa and confirmed selective differences of genes with disparate expression among male versus female sexual structures in this organism. The results held across various genotypes and stages of sexual development. Furthermore, our data showed that N. crassa comprises a rare example of an organism where female-biased genes evolve rapidly; they exhibited faster evolution at the protein level and reduced optimal codon usage compared with male-biased genes, sexually unbiased genes, and vegetative genes. Female-biased genes also had a greater portion of sites that experienced positive selection and showed stronger signals of selective sweeps than male-biased genes, suggesting that the rapid evolution is at least partly driven by adaptive evolution. Distinctive aspects of the reproductive biology of N. crassa which might explain the rapid evolution of female-biased genes are discussed, particularly the propensity for female-female competition during mating, as well as the multifunctional nature of male structures. The present findings open new opportunities to test hypotheses about sex-biased gene expression and molecular evolution.",?,Molecular biology and evolution,Sweden,2013 Nov

The carbohydrate moieties of AGPs consist of beta-1,3-galactan main chains and beta-1,6-galactan side chains, to which other auxiliary sugars are attached. To date, FvEn3GAL isolated from Flammulina velutipes is the sole beta-1,3-galactanase acting on beta-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner. Here we cloned two homologous genes, designated Af3G and NcEn3GAL, possibly encoding endo-beta-1,3-galactanase from Aspergillus flavus and Neurospora crassa, respectively. The recombinant Af3G (rAf3G) and rNcEn3GAL expressed in Pichia pastoris specifically hydrolyzed beta-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner, as did the rFvEn3GAL. Among galactooligosaccharides, beta-1,3-galactotriose was identified as the smallest substrate for these enzymes. These results suggest that enzymatic characteristics are conserved in many endo-beta-1,3-galactanases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 16 family. On the other hand, rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL generated more beta-1,3-galactobiose from beta-1,3-galactotetraose than did rFvEn3GAL, suggesting that rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL prefer hydrolyzing the central beta-1,3-glycosidic linkage of three in beta-1,3-galactotetraose. Although rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL alone hardly hydrolyze native AGP, they acted synergistically with a fungal exo-beta-1,3-galactanase on the AGP. These endo-beta-1,3-galactanases presumably aid hydrolysis by internally breaking up AGPs, which creates more sites of attack for exo-beta-1,3-galactanase.","['Arabinogalactan-protein', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Endo-beta-1,3-galactanase', 'Glycoside hydrolase family 16', 'Neurospora crassa']",Carbohydrate research,Japan,2017 Dec 1
26091498,Structure of Importin-alpha from a Filamentous Fungus in Complex with a Classical Nuclear Localization Signal.,"Neurospora crassa is a filamentous fungus that has been extensively studied as a model organism for eukaryotic biology, providing fundamental insights into cellular processes such as cell signaling, growth and differentiation. To advance in the study of this multicellular organism, an understanding of the specific mechanisms for protein transport into the cell nucleus is essential. Importin-alpha (Imp-alpha) is the receptor for cargo proteins that contain specific nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that play a key role in the classical nuclear import pathway. Structures of Imp-alpha from different organisms (yeast, rice, mouse, and human) have been determined, revealing that this receptor possesses a conserved structural scaffold. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the Impalpha mechanism of action may vary significantly for different organisms or for different isoforms from the same organism. Therefore, structural, functional, and biophysical characterization of different Impalpha proteins is necessary to understand the selectivity of nuclear transport. Here, we determined the first crystal structure of an Impalpha from a filamentous fungus which is also the highest resolution Impalpha structure already solved to date (1.75 A). In addition, we performed calorimetric analysis to determine the affinity and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between Imp-alpha and the classical SV40 NLS peptide. The comparison of these data with previous studies on Impalpha proteins led us to demonstrate that N. crassa Imp-alpha possess specific features that are distinct from mammalian Imp-alpha but exhibit important similarities to rice Imp-alpha, particularly at the minor NLS binding site.",?,PloS one,Brazil,2015
26474162,Characterization of Cercospora nicotianae Hypothetical Proteins in Cercosporin Resistance.,"The photoactivated toxin, cercosporin, produced by Cercospora species, plays an important role in pathogenesis of this fungus to host plants. Cercosporin has almost universal toxicity to cells due to its production of reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen. For that reason, Cercospora species, which are highly resistant to their own toxin, are good candidates to identify genes for resistance to cercosporin and to the reactive oxygen species it produces. In previous research, the zinc cluster transcription factor CRG1 (cercosporin resistance gene 1) was found to be crucial for Cercospora species' resistance against cercosporin, and subtractive hybridization analysis identified 185 genes differentially expressed between Cercospora nicotianae wild type (wt) and a crg1 mutant. The focus of this work was to identify and characterize the hypothetical proteins that were identified in the Cercospora nicotianae subtractive library as potential resistance factors. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the 20 genes encoding hypothetical proteins showed that two, 24cF and 71cR, were induced under conditions of cercosporin toxicity, suggesting a role in resistance. Transformation and expression of 24cF and 71cR in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus, Neurospora crassa, showed that 71cR provided increased resistance to cercosporin toxicity, whereas no significant increase was observed in 24cF transformants. Gene disruption was used to generate C. nicotianae 71cR mutants; these mutants did not differ from wt C. nicotianae in cercosporin resistance or production. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed induction of other resistance genes in the 71cR mutant that may compensate for the loss of 71cR. Analysis of 71cR conserved domains and secondary and tertiary structure identify the protein as having an NTF2-like superfamily DUF1348 domain with unknown function, to be intracellular and localized in the cytosol, and to have similarities to proteins in the steroid delta-isomerase family.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2015
23617799,Fungal siderophore biosynthesis is partially localized in peroxisomes.,"Siderophores play a central role in iron metabolism and virulence of most fungi. Both Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans excrete the siderophore triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC) for iron acquisition. In A. fumigatus, green fluorescence protein-tagging revealed peroxisomal localization of the TAFC biosynthetic enzymes SidI (mevalonyl-CoA ligase), SidH (mevalonyl-CoA hydratase) and SidF (anhydromevalonyl-CoA transferase), while elimination of the peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) impaired both, peroxisomal SidH-targeting and TAFC biosynthesis. The analysis of A. nidulans mutants deficient in peroxisomal biogenesis, ATP import or protein import revealed that cytosolic mislocalization of one or two but, interestingly, not all three enzymes impairs TAFC production during iron starvation. The PTS motifs are conserved in fungal orthologues of SidF, SidH and SidI. In agreement with the evolutionary conservation of the partial peroxisomal compartmentalization of fungal siderophore biosynthesis, the SidI orthologue of coprogen-type siderophore-producing Neurospora crassa was confirmed to be peroxisomal. Taken together, this study identified and characterized a novel, evolutionary conserved metabolic function of peroxisomes.",?,Molecular microbiology,Austria,2013 Jun
25143134,Deciphering the uniqueness of Mucoromycotina cell walls by combining biochemical and phylogenomic approaches.,"Most fungi from the Mucoromycotina lineage occur in ecosystems as saprobes, although some species are phytopathogens or may induce human mycosis. Mucoromycotina represent early diverging models that are most valuable for understanding fungal evolution. Here we reveal the uniqueness of the cell wall structure of the Mucoromycotina Rhizopus oryzae and Phycomyces blakesleeanus compared with the better characterized cell wall of the ascomycete Neurospora crassa. We have analysed the corresponding polysaccharide biosynthetic and modifying pathways, and highlight their evolutionary features and higher complexity in terms of gene copy numbers compared with species from other lineages. This work uncovers the presence in Mucoromycotina of abundant fucose-based polysaccharides similar to algal fucoidans. These unexpected polymers are associated with unusually low amounts of glucans and a higher proportion of chitin compared with N. crassa. The specific structural features are supported by the identification of genes potentially involved in the corresponding metabolic pathways. Phylogenomic analyses of genes encoding carbohydrate synthases, polysaccharide modifying enzymes and enzymes involved in nucleotide-sugar formation provide evidence for duplication events during evolution of cell wall metabolism in fungi. Altogether, the data highlight the specificity of Mucoromycotina cell walls and pave the way for a finer understanding of their metabolism.",?,Environmental microbiology,Sweden,2015 May

In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, genetically identical asexual spores (germlings) communicate and fuse in a highly regulated process, which is associated with fitness benefits during colony establishment. Recognition and chemotropic interactions between isogenic germlings requires oscillation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction protein complex (NRC-1, MEK-2, MAK-2, and the scaffold protein HAM-5) to specialized cell fusion structures termed conidial anastomosis tubes. Using a population of 110 wild N. crassa isolates, we investigated germling fusion between genetically unrelated individuals and discovered that chemotropic interactions are regulated by kind discrimination. Distinct communication groups were identified, in which germlings within one communication group interacted at high frequency, while germlings from different communication groups avoided each other. Bulk segregant analysis followed by whole genome resequencing identified three linked genes (doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3), which were associated with communication group phenotype. Alleles at doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3 fell into five haplotypes that showed transspecies polymorphism. Swapping doc-1 and doc-2 alleles from different communication group strains was necessary and sufficient to confer communication group affiliation. During chemotropic interactions, DOC-1 oscillated with MAK-2 to the tips of conidial anastomosis tubes, while DOC-2 was statically localized to the plasma membrane. Our data indicate that doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3 function as ""greenbeard"" genes, involved in mediating long-distance kind recognition that involves actively searching for one's own type, resulting in cooperation between non-genealogical relatives. Our findings serve as a basis for investigations into the mechanisms associated with attraction, fusion, and kind recognition in other eukaryotic species.",?,PLoS biology,United States of America,2016 Apr
26100701,Transcription factor ADS-4 regulates adaptive responses and resistance to antifungal azole stress.,"Azoles are commonly used as antifungal drugs or pesticides to control fungal infections in medicine and agriculture. Fungi adapt to azole stress by rapidly activating the transcription of a number of genes, and transcriptional increases in some azole-responsive genes can elevate azole resistance. The regulatory mechanisms that control transcriptional responses to azole stress in filamentous fungi are not well understood. This study identified a bZIP transcription factor, ADS-4 (antifungal drug sensitive-4), as a new regulator of adaptive responses and resistance to antifungal azoles. Transcription of ads-4 in Neurospora crassa cells increased when they were subjected to ketoconazole treatment, whereas the deletion of ads-4 resulted in hypersensitivity to ketoconazole and fluconazole. In contrast, the overexpression of ads-4 increased resistance to fluconazole and ketoconazole in N. crassa. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, followed by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR confirmation, showed that ADS-4 positively regulated the transcriptional responses of at least six genes to ketoconazole stress in N. crassa. The gene products of four ADS-4-regulated genes are known contributors to azole resistance, including the major efflux pump CDR4 (Pdr5p ortholog), an ABC multidrug transporter (NcAbcB), sterol C-22 desaturase (ERG5), and a lipid transporter (NcRTA2) that is involved in calcineurin-mediated azole resistance. Deletion of the ads-4-homologous gene Afads-4 in Aspergillus fumigatus caused hypersensitivity to itraconazole and ketoconazole, which suggested that ADS-4 is a functionally conserved regulator of adaptive responses to azoles. This study provides important information on a new azole resistance factor that could be targeted by a new range of antifungal pesticides and drugs.",?,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,China,2015 Sep
25702854,In vitro production and antifungal activity of peptide ABP-dHC-cecropin A.,"The antimicrobial peptide ABP-dHC-cecropin A is a small cationic peptide with potent activity against a wide range of bacterial species. Evidence of antifungal activity has also been suggested; however, testing of this peptide has been limited due to the low expression of cecropin proteins in Escherichia coli. To improve expression of this peptide in E. coli, ABP-dHC-cecropin A was cloned into a pSUMO vector and transformed into E. coli, resulting in the production of a pSUMO-ABP-dHC-cecropin A fusion protein. The soluble form of this protein was then purified by Ni-IDA chromatography, yielding a total of 496-mg protein per liter of fermentation culture. The SUMO-ABP-dHC-cecropin A fusion protein was then cleaved using a SUMO protease and re-purified by Ni-IDA chromatography, yielding a total of 158-mg recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A per liter of fermentation culture at a purity of >/=94%, the highest yield reported to date. Antifungal activity assays performed using this purified recombinant peptide revealed strong antifungal activity against both Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa, as well as Rhizopus, Fusarium, Alternaria, and Mucor species. Combined with previous analyses demonstrating strong antibacterial activity against a number of important bacterial pathogens, these results confirm the use of ABP-dHC-cecropin A as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide, with significant therapeutic potential.","['ABP-dHC-cecropin A', 'Antibacterial peptide', 'Antifungal activity', 'Escherichia coli expression', 'SUMO']",Journal of biotechnology,China,2015 Apr 10
26178376,Structural and Functional Characterization of a Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase with Broad Substrate Specificity.,"The recently discovered lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) carry out oxidative cleavage of polysaccharides and are of major importance for efficient processing of biomass. NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa acts both on cellulose and on non-cellulose beta-glucans, including cellodextrins and xyloglucan. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of NcLPMO9C revealed an extended, highly polar substrate-binding surface well suited to interact with a variety of sugar substrates. The ability of NcLPMO9C to act on soluble substrates was exploited to study enzyme-substrate interactions. EPR studies demonstrated that the Cu(2+) center environment is altered upon substrate binding, whereas isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed binding affinities in the low micromolar range for polymeric substrates that are due in part to the presence of a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1). Importantly, the novel structure of NcLPMO9C enabled a comparative study, revealing that the oxidative regioselectivity of LPMO9s (C1, C4, or both) correlates with distinct structural features of the copper coordination sphere. In strictly C1-oxidizing LPMO9s, access to the solvent-facing axial coordination position is restricted by a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas access to this same position seems unrestricted in C4-oxidizing LPMO9s. LPMO9s known to produce a mixture of C1- and C4-oxidized products show an intermediate situation.","['biodegradation', 'bioenergy', 'copper monooxygenase', 'crystal structure', 'electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)', 'isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Sweden,2015 Sep 18
25851692,Transcriptional refractoriness is dependent on core promoter architecture.,"Genes are often transcribed in random bursts followed by long periods of inactivity. Here we employ the light-activatable white collar complex (WCC) of Neurospora to study the transcriptional bursting with a population approach. Activation of WCC by a light pulse triggers a synchronized wave of transcription from the frequency promoter followed by an extended period ( approximately 1 h) during which the promoter is refractory towards restimulation. When challenged by a second light pulse, the newly activated WCC binds to refractory promoters and has the potential to recruit RNA polymerase II (Pol II). However, accumulation of Pol II and phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain repeats at serine 5 are impaired. Our results suggest that refractory promoters carry a physical memory of their recent transcription history. Genome-wide analysis of light-induced transcription suggests that refractoriness is rather widespread and a property of promoter architecture.",?,Nature communications,Germany,2015 Apr 8
23792917,Adoption of the Q transcriptional regulatory system for zebrafish transgenesis.,"The Gal4-UAS regulatory system of yeast is widely used to modulate gene expression in Drosophila; however, there are limitations to its usefulness in transgenic zebrafish, owing to progressive methylation and silencing of the CpG-rich multicopy upstream activation sequence. Although a modified, less repetitive UAS construct may overcome this problem, it is highly desirable to have additional transcriptional regulatory systems that can be applied independently or in combination with the Gal4/UAS system for intersectional gene expression. The Q transcriptional regulatory system of Neurospora crassa functions similarly to Gal4/UAS. QF is a transcriptional activator that binds to the QUAS upstream regulatory sequence to drive reporter gene expression. Unlike Gal4, the QF binding site does not contain essential CpG dinucleotide sequences that are subject to DNA methylation. The QS protein is a repressor of QF mediated transcriptional activation akin to Gal80. The functionality of the Q system has been demonstrated in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans and we now report its successful application to a vertebrate model, the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Several tissue-specific promoters were used to drive QF expression in stable transgenic lines, as assessed by activation of a QUAS:GFP transgene. The QS repressor was found to dramatically reduce QF activity in injected zebrafish embryos; however, a similar repression has not yet been achieved in transgenic animals expressing QS under the control of ubiquitous promoters. A dual reporter construct containing both QUAS and UAS, each upstream of different fluorescent proteins was also generated and tested in transient assays, demonstrating that the two systems can work in parallel within the same cell. The adoption of the Q system should greatly increase the versatility and power of transgenic approaches for regulating gene expression in zebrafish.","['Gal4', 'QF activator', 'QS repressor', 'Qa locus', 'Transcriptional activation']","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",USA,2014 Apr 1
31474536,Allorecognition upon Fungal Cell-Cell Contact Determines Social Cooperation and Impacts the Acquisition of Multicellularity.,"Somatic cell fusion and conspecific cooperation are crucial social traits for microbial unicellular-to-multicellular transitions, colony expansion, and substrate foraging but are also associated with risks of parasitism. We identified a cell wall remodeling (cwr) checkpoint that acts upon cell contact to assess genetic compatibility and regulate cell wall dissolution during somatic cell fusion in a wild population of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Non-allelic interactions between two linked loci, cwr-1 and cwr-2, were necessary and sufficient to block cell fusion: cwr-1 encodes a polysaccharide monooxygenase (PMO), a class of enzymes associated with extracellular degradative capacities, and cwr-2 encodes a predicted transmembrane protein. Mutations of sites in CWR-1 essential for PMO catalytic activity abolished the block in cell fusion between formerly incompatible strains. In Neurospora, alleles cwr-1 and cwr-2 were highly polymorphic, fell into distinct haplogroups, and showed trans-species polymorphisms. Distinct haplogroups and trans-species polymorphisms at cwr-1 and cwr-2 were also identified in the distantly related genus Fusarium, suggesting convergent evolution. Proteins involved in chemotropic processes showed extended localization at contact sites, suggesting that cwr regulates the transition between chemotropic growth and cell wall dissolution. Our work revealed an allorecognition surveillance system based on kind discrimination that inhibits cooperative behavior in fungi by blocking cell fusion upon contact, contributing to fungal immunity by preventing formation of chimeras between genetically non-identical colonies.","['Neurospora crassa', 'allorecognition', 'balancing selection', 'cell wall remodeling', 'cell-cell fusion', 'cooperation', 'kind recognition', 'multicellularity', 'polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'trans-species polymorphism']",Current biology : CB,USA,2019 Sep 23
33753477,DNA affinity purification sequencing and transcriptional profiling reveal new aspects of nitrogen regulation in a filamentous fungus.,"Sensing available nutrients and efficiently utilizing them is a challenge common to all organisms. The model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is capable of utilizing a variety of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources. Nitrogen utilization in N. crassa is regulated by a network of pathway-specific transcription factors that activate genes necessary to utilize specific nitrogen sources in combination with nitrogen catabolite repression regulatory proteins. We identified an uncharacterized pathway-specific transcription factor, amn-1, that is required for utilization of the nonpreferred nitrogen sources proline, branched-chain amino acids, and aromatic amino acids. AMN-1 also plays a role in regulating genes involved in responding to the simple sugar mannose, suggesting an integration of nitrogen and carbon metabolism. The utilization of nonpreferred nitrogen sources, which require metabolic processing before being used as a nitrogen source, is also regulated by the nitrogen catabolite regulator NIT-2. Using RNA sequencing combined with DNA affinity purification sequencing, we performed a survey of the role of NIT-2 and the pathway-specific transcription factors NIT-4 and AMN-1 in directly regulating genes involved in nitrogen utilization. Although previous studies suggested promoter binding by both a pathway-specific transcription factor and NIT-2 may be necessary for activation of nitrogen-responsive genes, our data show that pathway-specific transcription factors regulate genes involved in the catabolism of specific nitrogen sources, while NIT-2 regulates genes involved in utilization of all nonpreferred nitrogen sources, such as nitrogen transporters. Together, these transcription factors form a nutrient sensing network that allows N. crassa cells to regulate nitrogen utilization.","['DAPseq', 'RNAseq', 'nitrogen utilization', 'nutrient sensing', 'transcriptional networks']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CA 94720; huberman@cornell.edu Lglass@berkeley.edu,2021 Mar 30
33346193,Neutron Crystallography Data Collection and Processing for Modelling Hydrogen Atoms in Protein Structures.,"Neutron crystallography is a structural technique that allows determination of hydrogen atom positions within biological macromolecules, yielding mechanistically important information about protonation and hydration states while not inducing radiation damage. X-ray diffraction, in contrast, provides only limited information on the position of light atoms and the X-ray beam rapidly induces radiation damage of photosensitive cofactors and metal centers. Presented here is the workflow employed for the IMAGINE and MaNDi beamlines at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to obtain a neutron diffraction structure once a protein crystal of suitable size (> 0.1 mm(3)) has been grown. We demonstrate mounting of hydrogenated protein crystals in quartz capillaries for neutron diffraction data collection. Also presented is the vapor exchange process of the mounted crystals with D2O-containing buffer to ensure replacement of hydrogen atoms at exchangeable sites with deuterium. The incorporation of deuterium reduces the background arising from the incoherent scattering of hydrogen atoms and prevents density cancellation caused by their negative coherent scattering length. Sample alignment and room temperature data collection strategies are illustrated using quasi-Laue data collection at IMAGINE at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). Furthermore, crystal mounting and rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen for cryo-data collection to trap labile reaction intermediates is demonstrated at the MaNDi time-of-flight instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). Preparation of the model coordinate and diffraction data files and visualization of the neutron scattering length density (SLD) maps will also be addressed. Structure refinement against neutron data-only or against joint X-ray/neutron data to obtain an all-atom structure of the protein of interest will finally be discussed. The process of determining a neutron structure will be demonstrated using crystals of the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase Neurospora crassa LPMO9D, a copper-containing metalloprotein involved in the degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides via oxidative cleavage of the glycosidic bond.",?,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2020 Dec 1
28096492,Identification of Glutaminyl Cyclase Genes Involved in Pyroglutamate Modification of Fungal Lignocellulolytic Enzymes.,"The breakdown of plant biomass to simple sugars is essential for the production of second-generation biofuels and high-value bioproducts. Currently, enzymes produced from filamentous fungi are used for deconstructing plant cell wall polysaccharides into fermentable sugars for biorefinery applications. A post-translational N-terminal pyroglutamate modification observed in some of these enzymes occurs when N-terminal glutamine or glutamate is cyclized to form a five-membered ring. This modification has been shown to confer resistance to thermal denaturation for CBH-1 and EG-1 cellulases. In mammalian cells, the formation of pyroglutamate is catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclases. Using the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, we identified two genes (qc-1 and qc-2) that encode proteins homologous to mammalian glutaminyl cyclases. We show that qc-1 and qc-2 are essential for catalyzing the formation of an N-terminal pyroglutamate on CBH-1 and GH5-1. CBH-1 and GH5-1 produced in a Deltaqc-1 Deltaqc-2 mutant, and thus lacking the N-terminal pyroglutamate modification, showed greater sensitivity to thermal denaturation, and for GH5-1, susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage. QC-1 and QC-2 are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized proteins. The pyroglutamate modification is predicted to occur in a number of additional fungal proteins that have diverse functions. The identification of glutaminyl cyclases in fungi may have implications for production of lignocellulolytic enzymes, heterologous expression, and biotechnological applications revolving around protein stability. IMPORTANCE: Pyroglutamate modification is the post-translational conversion of N-terminal glutamine or glutamate into a cyclized amino acid derivative. This modification is well studied in animal systems but poorly explored in fungal systems. In Neurospora crassa, we show that this modification takes place in the ER and is catalyzed by two well-conserved enzymes, ubiquitously conserved throughout the fungal kingdom. We demonstrate that the modification is important for the structural stability and aminopeptidase resistance of CBH-1 and GH5-1, two important cellulase enzymes utilized in industrial plant cell wall deconstruction. Many additional fungal proteins predicted in the genome of N. crassa and other filamentous fungi are predicted to carry an N-terminal pyroglutamate modification. Pyroglutamate addition may also be a useful way to stabilize secreted proteins and peptides, which can be easily produced in fungal production systems.",?,mBio,USA,2017 Jan 17
33051654,MOSAIC: a joint modeling methodology for combined circadian and non-circadian analysis of multi-omics data.,"MOTIVATION: Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-h endogenous cycles that control many biological functions. To identify these rhythms, biological samples are taken over circadian time and analyzed using a single omics type, such as transcriptomics or proteomics. By comparing data from these single omics approaches, it has been shown that transcriptional rhythms are not necessarily conserved at the protein level, implying extensive circadian post-transcriptional regulation. However, as proteomics methods are known to be noisier than transcriptomic methods, this suggests that previously identified arrhythmic proteins with rhythmic transcripts could have been missed due to noise and may not be due to post-transcriptional regulation. RESULTS: To determine if one can use information from less-noisy transcriptomic data to inform rhythms in more-noisy proteomic data, and thus more accurately identify rhythms in the proteome, we have created the Multi-Omics Selection with Amplitude Independent Criteria (MOSAIC) application. MOSAIC combines model selection and joint modeling of multiple omics types to recover significant circadian and non-circadian trends. Using both synthetic data and proteomic data from Neurospora crassa, we showed that MOSAIC accurately recovers circadian rhythms at higher rates in not only the proteome but the transcriptome as well, outperforming existing methods for rhythm identification. In addition, by quantifying non-circadian trends in addition to circadian trends in data, our methodology allowed for the recognition of the diversity of circadian regulation as compared to non-circadian regulation.

27694235,Internalization of Heterologous Sugar Transporters by Endogenous alpha-Arrestins in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using either of two constitutive yeast promoters (PGK1(prom) and CCW12(prom)), the transporters CDT-1 and CDT-2 from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa are able to catalyze, respectively, active transport and facilitated diffusion of cellobiose (and, for CDT-2, also xylan and its derivatives). In S. cerevisiae, endogenous permeases are removed from the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and are marked for internalization through ubiquitinylation catalyzed by Rsp5, a HECT class ubiquitin:protein ligase (E3). Recruitment of Rsp5 to specific targets is mediated by a 14-member family of endocytic adaptor proteins, termed alpha-arrestins. Here we demonstrate that CDT-1 and CDT-2 are subject to alpha-arrestin-mediated endocytosis, that four alpha-arrestins (Rod1, Rog3, Aly1, and Aly2) are primarily responsible for this internalization, that the presence of the transport substrate promotes transporter endocytosis, and that, at least for CDT-2, residues located in its C-terminal cytosolic domain are necessary for its efficient endocytosis. Both alpha-arrestin-deficient cells expressing CDT-2 and otherwise wild-type cells expressing CDT-2 mutants unresponsive to alpha-arrestin-driven internalization exhibit an increased level of plasma membrane-localized transporter compared to that of wild-type cells, and they grow, utilize the transport substrate, and generate ethanol anaerobically better than control cells. IMPORTANCE: Ethanolic fermentation of the breakdown products of plant biomass by budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae remains an attractive biofuel source. To achieve this end, genes for heterologous sugar transporters and the requisite enzyme(s) for subsequent metabolism have been successfully expressed in this yeast. For one of the heterologous transporters examined in this study, we found that the amount of this protein residing in the plasma membrane was the rate-limiting factor for utilization of the cognate carbon source (cellobiose) and its conversion to ethanol.",?,Applied and environmental microbiology,USA,2016 Dec 15

Here we confirm using an LC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis, that poly-saturated dolichols are abundant in other filamentous fungi, Trichoderma reesei, A. nidulans and Neurospora crassa, while the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae only contains the typical mono-saturated dolichols. We also show, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-l,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) that the structure of dolichols modulates the properties of membranes and affects the functioning of dolichyl diphosphate mannose synthase (DPMS). The activity of this enzyme from T. reesei and S. cerevisiae was strongly affected by the structure of dolichols. Additionally, the structure of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) model membranes was more strongly disturbed by the poly-saturated dolichols from Trichoderma than by the mono-saturated dolichols from yeast. By comparing the lipidome of filamentous fungi with that from S. cerevisiae, we revealed significant differences in the PC/PE ratio and fatty acids composition. Filamentous fungi differ from S. cerevisiae in the lipid composition of their membranes and the structure of dolichols. The structure of dolichols profoundly affects the functioning of dolichol-dependent enzyme, DPMS.","['dolichyl phosphate mannose synthase', 'filamentous fungi', 'lipidome', 'poly-saturated dolichols', 'yeast']",International journal of molecular sciences,Poland. egryz@ibb.wwaw.pl,2019 Jun 21
24692637,Discovering functions of unannotated genes from a transcriptome survey of wild fungal isolates.,"Most fungal genomes are poorly annotated, and many fungal traits of industrial and biomedical relevance are not well suited to classical genetic screens. Assigning genes to phenotypes on a genomic scale thus remains an urgent need in the field. We developed an approach to infer gene function from expression profiles of wild fungal isolates, and we applied our strategy to the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Using transcriptome measurements in 70 strains from two well-defined clades of this microbe, we first identified 2,247 cases in which the expression of an unannotated gene rose and fell across N. crassa strains in parallel with the expression of well-characterized genes. We then used image analysis of hyphal morphologies, quantitative growth assays, and expression profiling to test the functions of four genes predicted from our population analyses. The results revealed two factors that influenced regulation of metabolism of nonpreferred carbon and nitrogen sources, a gene that governed hyphal architecture, and a gene that mediated amino acid starvation resistance. These findings validate the power of our population-transcriptomic approach for inference of novel gene function, and we suggest that this strategy will be of broad utility for genome-scale annotation in many fungal systems. IMPORTANCE Some fungal species cause deadly infections in humans or crop plants, and other fungi are workhorses of industrial chemistry, including the production of biofuels. Advances in medical and industrial mycology require an understanding of the genes that control fungal traits. We developed a method to infer functions of uncharacterized genes by observing correlated expression of their mRNAs with those of known genes across wild fungal isolates. We applied this strategy to a filamentous fungus and predicted functions for thousands of unknown genes. In four cases, we experimentally validated the predictions from our method, discovering novel genes involved in the metabolism of nutrient sources relevant for biofuel production, as well as colony morphology and starvation resistance. Our strategy is straightforward, inexpensive, and applicable for predicting gene function in many fungal species.",?,mBio,,2014 Apr 1
35217617,"Casein kinase 1 and disordered clock proteins form functionally equivalent, phospho-based circadian modules in fungi and mammals.","Circadian clocks are timing systems that rhythmically adjust physiology and metabolism to the 24-h day-night cycle. Eukaryotic circadian clocks are based on transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs). Yet TTFL-core components such as Frequency (FRQ) in Neurospora and Periods (PERs) in animals are not conserved, leaving unclear how a 24-h period is measured on the molecular level. Here, we show that CK1 is sufficient to promote FRQ and mouse PER2 (mPER2) hyperphosphorylation on a circadian timescale by targeting a large number of low-affinity phosphorylation sites. Slow phosphorylation kinetics rely on site-specific recruitment of Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) and access of intrinsically disordered segments of FRQ or mPER2 to bound CK1 and on CK1 autoinhibition. Compromising CK1 activity and substrate binding affects the circadian clock in Neurospora and mammalian cells, respectively.

FRH crystal structures in several conformations and bound to ADP/RNA reveal differences between FRH and the yeast homolog Mtr4 that clarify the distinct role of FRH in the clock. The FRQ-interacting region at the FRH N-terminus has variable structure in the absence of FRQ A known mutation that disrupts circadian rhythms (R806H) resides in a positively charged surface of the KOW domain, far removed from the helicase core. We show that changes to other similarly located residues modulate interactions with the WCC and FRQ A V142G substitution near the N-terminus also alters FRQ and WCC binding to FRH, but produces an unusual short clock period. These data support the assertion that FRH helicase activity does not play an essential role in the clock, but rather FRH acts to mediate contacts among FRQ, CK1a and the WCC through interactions involving its N-terminus and KOW module.","['chaperone', 'circadian clock', 'protein interactions', 'protein structure', 'transcriptional repressor']",The EMBO journal,USA,2016 Aug 1
25880035,Inferring bona fide transfrags in RNA-Seq derived-transcriptome assemblies of non-model organisms.,"BACKGROUND: De novo transcriptome assembly of short transcribed fragments (transfrags) produced from sequencing-by-synthesis technologies often results in redundant datasets with differing levels of unassembled, partially assembled or mis-assembled transcripts. Post-assembly processing intended to reduce redundancy typically involves reassembly or clustering of assembled sequences. However, these approaches are mostly based on common word heuristics and often create clusters of biologically unrelated sequences, resulting in loss of unique transfrags annotations and propagation of mis-assemblies. RESULTS: Here, we propose a structured framework that consists of a few steps in pipeline architecture for Inferring Functionally Relevant Assembly-derived Transcripts (IFRAT). IFRAT combines 1) removal of identical subsequences, 2) error tolerant CDS prediction, 3) identification of coding potential, and 4) complements BLAST with a multiple domain architecture annotation that reduces non-specific domain annotation. We demonstrate that independent of the assembler, IFRAT selects bona fide transfrags (with CDS and coding potential) from the transcriptome assembly of a model organism without relying on post-assembly clustering or reassembly. The robustness of IFRAT is inferred on RNA-Seq data of Neurospora crassa assembled using de Bruijn graph-based assemblers, in single (Trinity and Oases-25) and multiple (Oases-Merge and additive or pooled) k-mer modes. Single k-mer assemblies contained fewer transfrags compared to the multiple k-mer assemblies. However, Trinity identified a comparable number of predicted coding sequence and gene loci to Oases pooled assembly. IFRAT selects bona fide transfrags representing over 94% of cumulative BLAST-derived functional annotations of the unfiltered assemblies. Between 4-6% are lost when orphan transfrags are excluded and this represents only a tiny fraction of annotation derived from functional transference by sequence similarity. The median length of bona fide transfrags ranged from 1.5kb (Trinity) to 2kb (Oases), which is consistent with the average coding sequence length in fungi. The fraction of transfrags that could be associated with gene ontology terms ranged from 33-50%, which is also high for domain based annotation. We showed that unselected transfrags were mostly truncated and represent sequences from intronic, untranslated (5' and 3') regions and non-coding gene loci. CONCLUSIONS: IFRAT simplifies post-assembly processing providing a reference transcriptome enriched with functionally relevant assembly-derived transcripts for non-model organism.",?,BMC bioinformatics,South Africa. mbandi@sanbi.ac.za,2015 Feb 21
27002152,Suppression of WHITE COLLAR-independent frequency Transcription by Histone H3 Lysine 36 Methyltransferase SET-2 Is Necessary for Clock Function in Neurospora.,"The circadian system in Neurospora is based on the transcriptional/translational feedback loops and rhythmic frequency (frq) transcription requires the WHITE COLLAR (WC) complex. Our previous paper has shown that frq could be transcribed in a WC-independent pathway in a strain lacking the histone H3K36 methyltransferase, SET-2 (su(var)3-9-enhancer-of-zeste-trithorax-2) (1), but the mechanism was unclear. Here we disclose that loss of histone H3K36 methylation, due to either deletion of SET-2 or H3K36R mutation, results in arrhythmic frq transcription and loss of overt rhythmicity. Histone acetylation at frq locus increases in set-2(KO) mutant. Consistent with these results, loss of H3K36 methylation readers, histone deacetylase RPD-3 (reduced potassium dependence 3) or EAF-3 (essential SAS-related acetyltransferase-associated factor 3), also leads to hyperacetylation of histone at frq locus and WC-independent frq expression, suggesting that proper chromatin modification at frq locus is required for circadian clock operation. Furthermore, a mutant strain with three amino acid substitutions (histone H3 lysine 9, 14, and 18 to glutamine) was generated to mimic the strain with hyperacetylation state of histone H3. H3K9QK14QK18Q mutant exhibits the same defective clock phenotype as rpd-3(KO) mutant. Our results support a scenario in which H3K36 methylation is required to establish a permissive chromatin state for circadian frq transcription by maintaining proper acetylation status at frq locus.","['Neurospora', 'SET-2 pathway', 'WC-independent frq', 'circadian rhythm', 'clock gene', 'gene transcription', 'histone modification']",The Journal of biological chemistry,China,2016 May 20
26048019,"Control of mRNA Stability in Fungi by NMD, EJC and CBC Factors Through 3'UTR Introns.","In higher eukaryotes the accelerated degradation of mRNAs harboring premature termination codons is controlled by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), exon junction complex (EJC), and nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) factors, but the mechanistic basis for this quality-control system and the specific roles of the individual factors remain unclear. Using Neurospora crassa as a model system, we analyzed the mechanisms by which NMD is induced by spliced 3'-UTR introns or upstream open reading frames and observed that the former requires NMD, EJC, and CBC factors whereas the latter requires only the NMD factors. The transcripts for EJC components eIF4A3 and Y14, and translation termination factor eRF1, contain spliced 3'-UTR introns and each was stabilized in NMD, EJC, and CBC mutants. Reporter mRNAs containing spliced 3'-UTR introns, but not matched intronless controls, were stabilized in these mutants and were enriched in mRNPs immunopurified from wild-type cells with antibody directed against human Y14, demonstrating a direct role for spliced 3'-UTR introns in triggering EJC-mediated NMD. These results demonstrate conclusively that NMD, EJC, and CBC factors have essential roles in controlling mRNA stability and that, based on differential requirements for these factors, there are branched mechanisms for NMD. They demonstrate for the first time autoregulatory control of expression at the level of mRNA stability through the EJC/CBC branch of NMD for EJC core components, eIF4A3 and Y14, and for eRF1, which recognizes termination codons. Finally, these results show that EJC-mediated NMD occurs in fungi and thus is an evolutionarily conserved quality-control mechanism.","['Neurospora crassa', 'RNA stability', 'cap-binding complex (CBC)', 'exon junction complex (EJC)', 'nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)', 'post-transcriptional control', 'ribosome', ""spliced 3'-UTR intron"", 'translation']",Genetics,Texas 77843-3258,2015 Aug
33830078,Preliminary results of neutron and X-ray diffraction data collection on a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase under reduced and acidic conditions.,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-center enzymes that are involved in the oxidative cleavage of the glycosidic bond in crystalline cellulose and other polysaccharides. The LPMO reaction is initiated by the addition of a reductant and oxygen to ultimately form an unknown activated copper-oxygen species that is responsible for polysaccharide-substrate H-atom abstraction. Given the sensitivity of metalloproteins to radiation damage, neutron protein crystallography provides a nondestructive technique for structural characterization while also informing on the positions of H atoms. Neutron cryo-crystallography permits the trapping of catalytic intermediates, thereby providing insight into the protonation states and chemical nature of otherwise short-lived species in the reaction mechanism. To characterize the reaction-mechanism intermediates of LPMO9D from Neurospora crassa, a cryo-neutron diffraction data set was collected from an ascorbate-reduced crystal. A second neutron diffraction data set was collected at room temperature from an LPMO9D crystal exposed to low-pH conditions to probe the protonation states of ionizable groups involved in catalysis under acidic conditions.","['Neurospora crassa', 'enzymatic mechanism', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases', 'neutron protein crystallography', 'protonation', 'reduction']","Acta crystallographica.

24324265,A C4-oxidizing lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase cleaving both cellulose and cello-oligosaccharides.,"Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable resource that significantly can substitute fossil resources for the production of fuels, chemicals, and materials. Efficient saccharification of this biomass to fermentable sugars will be a key technology in future biorefineries. Traditionally, saccharification was thought to be accomplished by mixtures of hydrolytic enzymes. However, recently it has been shown that lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) contribute to this process by catalyzing oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides utilizing a mechanism involving molecular oxygen and an electron donor. These enzymes thus represent novel tools for the saccharification of plant biomass. Most characterized LPMOs, including all reported bacterial LPMOs, form aldonic acids, i.e., products oxidized in the C1 position of the terminal sugar. Oxidation at other positions has been observed, and there has been some debate concerning the nature of this position (C4 or C6). In this study, we have characterized an LPMO from Neurospora crassa (NcLPMO9C; also known as NCU02916 and NcGH61-3). Remarkably, and in contrast to all previously characterized LPMOs, which are active only on polysaccharides, NcLPMO9C is able to cleave soluble cello-oligosaccharides as short as a tetramer, a property that allowed detailed product analysis. Using mass spectrometry and NMR, we show that the cello-oligosaccharide products released by this enzyme contain a C4 gemdiol/keto group at the nonreducing end.","['AA10', 'AA9', 'Biofuel', 'CBM33', 'Cellulase', 'GH61', 'Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase (LPMO)', 'Mass Spectrometry (MS)', 'Metalloenzymes', 'NMR']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Norway,2014 Jan 31
29259126,Active-site copper reduction promotes substrate binding of fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase and reduces stability.,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a class of copper-containing enzymes that oxidatively degrade insoluble plant polysaccharides and soluble oligosaccharides. Upon reductive activation, they cleave the substrate and promote biomass degradation by hydrolytic enzymes. In this study, we employed LPMO9C from Neurospora crassa, which is active toward cellulose and soluble beta-glucans, to study the enzyme-substrate interaction and thermal stability. Binding studies showed that the reduction of the mononuclear active-site copper by ascorbic acid increased the affinity and the maximum binding capacity of LPMO for cellulose. The reduced redox state of the active-site copper and not the subsequent formation of the activated oxygen species increased the affinity toward cellulose. The lower affinity of oxidized LPMO could support its desorption after catalysis and allow hydrolases to access the cleavage site. It also suggests that the copper reduction is not necessarily performed in the substrate-bound state of LPMO. Differential scanning fluorimetry showed a stabilizing effect of the substrates cellulose and xyloglucan on the apparent transition midpoint temperature of the reduced, catalytically active enzyme. Oxidative auto-inactivation and destabilization were observed in the absence of a suitable substrate. Our data reveal the determinants of LPMO stability under turnover and non-turnover conditions and indicate that the reduction of the active-site copper initiates substrate binding.","['Active-site copper', 'carbohydrate-binding protein', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'metalloenzyme', 'plant cell wall', 'polysaccharide', 'protein stability']",The Journal of biological chemistry,and daniel.kracher@boku.ac.at,2018 Feb 2

31266859,Crosstalk of Cellulose and Mannan Perception Pathways Leads to Inhibition of Cellulase Production in Several Filamentous Fungi.,"It is essential for microbes to acquire information about their environment. Fungi use soluble degradation products of plant cell wall components to understand the substrate composition they grow on. Individual perception pathways have been well described. However, the interconnections between pathways remain poorly understood. In the present work, we provide evidence of crosstalk between the perception pathways for cellulose and the hemicellulose mannan being conserved in several filamentous fungi and leading to the inhibition of cellulase expression. We used the functional genomics tools available for Neurospora crassa to investigate this overlap at the molecular level. Crosstalk and competitive inhibition could be identified both during uptake by cellodextrin transporters and intracellularly. Importantly, the overlap is independent of CRE-1-mediated catabolite repression. These results provide novel insights into the regulatory networks of lignocellulolytic fungi and will contribute to the rational optimization of fungal enzyme production for efficient plant biomass depolymerization and utilization.IMPORTANCE In fungi, the production of enzymes for polysaccharide degradation is controlled by complex signaling networks. Previously, these networks were studied in response to simple sugars or single polysaccharides. Here, we tackled for the first time the molecular interplay between two seemingly unrelated perception pathways: those for cellulose and the hemicellulose (gluco)mannan. We identified a so far unknown competitive inhibition between the respective degradation products acting as signaling molecules. Competition was detected both at the level of the uptake and intracellularly, upstream of the main transcriptional regulator CLR-2. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular communication between perception pathways. Also, they present possible targets for the improvement of industrial strains for higher cellulase production through the engineering of mannan insensitivity.","['Neurospora crassa', 'cellulose/hemicellulose signaling', 'competitive inhibition', 'filamentous fungi', 'plant cell wall degradation']",mBio,Germany,2019 Jul 2
31289902,Amino acid secretion influences the size and composition of copper carbonate nanoparticles synthesized by ureolytic fungi.,"The ureolytic activity of Neurospora crassa results in an alkaline carbonate-rich culture medium which can precipitate soluble metals as insoluble carbonates. Such carbonates are smaller, often of nanoscale dimensions, than metal carbonates synthesized abiotically which infers that fungal excreted products can markedly affect particle size. In this work, it was found that amino acid excretion was a significant factor in affecting the particle size of copper carbonate. Eleven different amino acids were found to be secreted by Neurospora crassa, and L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid and L-cysteine were chosen to examine the impact of amino acids on the morphology and chemical composition of copper carbonate minerals. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the obtained copper carbonate samples. Copper carbonate nanoparticles with a diameter of 100-200 nm were produced with L-glutamic acid, and the presence of L-glutamic acid was found to stabilize these particles in the early phase of crystal growth and prevent them from aggregation. FTIR and TG analysis revealed that the amino acid moieties were intimately associated with the copper mineral particles. Component analysis of the final products of TG analysis of the copper minerals synthesized under various conditions showed the ultimate formation of Cu, Cu(2)O and Cu(2)S, suggesting a novel synthesis method for producing these useful Cu-containing materials.","['Amino acids', 'Biomineralization', 'Copper carbonate', 'Fungi', 'Nanoparticles']",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,UK,2019 Sep
28214601,The inhibition of mating in Phycomyces blakesleeanus by light is dependent on the MadA-MadB complex that acts in a sex-specific manner.,"Light is an environmental signal that influences reproduction in the Mucoromycotina fungi, as it does in many other species of fungi. Mating in Phycomyces blakesleeanus is inhibited by light, but the molecular mechanisms for this inhibition are uncharacterized. In this analysis, the role of the light-sensing MadA-MadB complex in mating was tested. The MadA-MadB complex is homologous to the Neurospora crassa White Collar complex. Three genes required for cell type determination in the sex locus or pheromone biosynthesis are transcriptionally-regulated by light and are controlled by MadA and MadB. This regulation acts through the plus partner, indicating that the inhibitory effect of light on mating is executed through only one of the two sexes. These results are an example whereby the mating types of fungi have acquired sex-specific properties beyond their role in conferring cell-type identity, and provide insight into how sex-determining chromosomal regions can expand the traits they control.","['Blue light sensing', 'HMG-domain', 'Mating type locus', 'Mucorales']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,USA,2017 Apr
23916612,"Characterization of bud emergence 46 (BEM46) protein: sequence, structural, phylogenetic and subcellular localization analyses.","The bud emergence 46 (BEM46) protein from Neurospora crassa belongs to the alpha/beta-hydrolase superfamily. Recently, we have reported that the BEM46 protein is localized in the perinuclear ER and also forms spots close by the plasma membrane. The protein appears to be required for cell type-specific polarity formation in N. crassa. Furthermore, initial studies suggested that the BEM46 amino acid sequence is conserved in eukaryotes and is considered to be one of the widespread conserved ""known unknown"" eukaryotic genes. This warrants for a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of this superfamily to unravel origin and molecular evolution of these genes in different eukaryotes. Herein, we observe that all eukaryotes have at least a single copy of a bem46 ortholog. Upon scanning of these proteins in various genomes, we find that there are expansions leading into several paralogs in vertebrates. Usingcomparative genomic analyses, we identified insertion/deletions (indels) in the conserved domain of BEM46 protein, which allow to differentiate fungal classes such as ascomycetes from basidiomycetes. We also find that exonic indels are able to differentiate BEM46 homologs of different eukaryotic lineage. Furthermore, we unravel that BEM46 protein from N. crassa possess a novel endoplasmic-retention signal (PEKK) using GFP-fusion tagging experiments. We propose that three residues namely a serine 188S, a histidine 292H and an aspartic acid 262D are most critical residues, forming a catalytic triad in BEM46 protein from N. crassa. We carried out a comprehensive study on bem46 genes from a molecular evolution perspective with combination of functional analyses. The evolutionary history of BEM46 proteins is characterized by exonic indels in lineage specific manner.","['Bud emergence 46 (bem46)', 'Endoplasmic retention signal', 'Evolution', 'Fungi', 'Indels', 'eGFP-fusion', 'alpha/beta-hydrolase']",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Germany,2013 Aug 30
27016805,Functional characterization of the Woronin body protein WscA of the pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Woronin bodies are fungal-specific organelles that seal damaged hyphal compartments and thereby contribute to the stress resistance and virulence of filamentous fungi. In this study, we have characterized the Aspergillus fumigatus Woronin body protein WscA. WscA is homologous to Neurospora crassa WSC, a protein that was shown to be important for biogenesis, segregation and positioning of Woronin bodies. WscA and WSC both belong to the Mpv17/PMP22 family of peroxisomal membrane proteins. An A. fumigatus DeltawscA mutant is unable to form Woronin bodies, and HexA, the protein that forms the crystal-like core of Woronin bodies, accumulates in large peroxisomes instead. The DeltawscA mutant showed no defect in segregation of HexA containing organelles, as has been reported for the corresponding N. crassa mutant. In the peroxisomes of the A. fumigatus mutant, HexA assembles into compact, donut-shaped structures. Experiments with GFP fusion proteins revealed that WscA function is highly sensitive to these modifications, in particular to an N-terminal fusion of GFP. In N. crassa, WSC was shown to be essentially required for Woronin body positioning, but the respective domain is not conserved in most other Pezizomycotina, including A. fumigatus. We have recently found evidence that HexA may have a direct role in WB positioning, since a HexA-GFP fusion protein, lacking a functional PTS1 motif, is efficiently recruited to the septal pore. In the current study we show that this targeting of HexA-GFP is independent of WscA.","['Aspergillus fumigatus', 'HexA', 'Peroxisome', 'Septum', 'Woronin body', 'WscA']",International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM,Germany,2016 May
34526526,Versatile cell-based assay for measuring DNA alkylation damage and its repair.,"DNA alkylation damage induced by environmental carcinogens, chemotherapy drugs, or endogenous metabolites plays a central role in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and cancer therapy. Base excision repair (BER) is a conserved, front line DNA repair pathway that removes alkylation damage from DNA. The capacity of BER to repair DNA alkylation varies markedly between different cell types and tissues, which correlates with cancer risk and cellular responses to alkylation chemotherapy. The ability to measure cellular rates of alkylation damage repair by the BER pathway is critically important for better understanding of the fundamental processes involved in carcinogenesis, and also to advance development of new therapeutic strategies. Methods for assessing the rates of alkylation damage and repair, especially in human cells, are limited, prone to significant variability due to the unstable nature of some of the alkyl adducts, and often rely on indirect measurements of BER activity. Here, we report a highly reproducible and quantitative, cell-based assay, named alk-BER (alkylation Base Excision Repair) for measuring rates of BER following alkylation DNA damage. The alk-BER assay involves specific detection of methyl DNA adducts (7-methyl guanine and 3-methyl adenine) directly in genomic DNA. The assay has been developed and adapted to measure the activity of BER in fungal model systems and human cell lines. Considering the specificity and conserved nature of BER enzymes, the assay can be adapted to virtually any type of cultured cells. Alk-BER offers a cost efficient and reliable method that can effectively complement existing approaches to advance integrative research on mechanisms of alkylation DNA damage and repair.",?,Scientific reports,USA,2021 Sep 15
30553726,Circadian Proteomic Analysis Uncovers Mechanisms of Post-Transcriptional Regulation in Metabolic Pathways.,"Transcriptional and translational feedback loops in fungi and animals drive circadian rhythms in transcript levels that provide output from the clock, but post-transcriptional mechanisms also contribute. To determine the extent and underlying source of this regulation, we applied newly developed analytical tools to a long-duration, deeply sampled, circadian proteomics time course comprising half of the proteome. We found a quarter of expressed proteins are clock regulated, but >40% of these do not arise from clock-regulated transcripts, and our analysis predicts that these protein rhythms arise from oscillations in translational rates. Our data highlighted the impact of the clock on metabolic regulation, with central carbon metabolism reflecting both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control and opposing metabolic pathways showing peak activities at different times of day. The transcription factor CSP-1 plays a role in this metabolic regulation, contributing to the rhythmicity and phase of clock-regulated proteins.","['CSP-1', 'Neurospora', 'circadian', 'metabolism', 'post-transcriptional regulation', 'proteome', 'tandem mass tag mass spectrometry', 'translational elongation']",Cell systems,USA.

28650145,The DEAD-Box Protein CYT-19 Uses Arginine Residues in Its C-Tail To Tether RNA Substrates.,"DEAD-box proteins are nonprocessive RNA helicases that play diverse roles in cellular processes. The Neurospora crassa DEAD-box protein CYT-19 promotes mitochondrial group I intron splicing and functions as a general RNA chaperone. CYT-19 includes a disordered, arginine-rich ""C-tail"" that binds RNA, positioning the helicase core to capture and unwind nearby RNA helices. Here we probed the C-tail further by varying the number and positions of arginines within it. We found that removing sets of as few as four of the 11 arginines reduced RNA unwinding activity (k(cat)/K(M)) to a degree equivalent to that seen upon removal of the C-tail, suggesting that a minimum or ""threshold"" number of arginines is required. In addition, a mutant with 16 arginines displayed RNA unwinding activity greater than that of wild-type CYT-19. The C-tail modifications impacted unwinding only of RNA helices within constructs that included an adjacent helix or structured RNA element that would allow C-tail binding, indicating that the helicase core remained active in the mutants. In addition, changes in RNA unwinding efficiency of the mutants were mirrored by changes in functional RNA affinity, as determined from the RNA concentration dependence of ATPase activity, suggesting that the C-tail functions primarily to increase RNA affinity. Interestingly, the salt concentration dependence of RNA unwinding activity is unaffected by C-tail composition, suggesting that the C-tail uses primarily hydrogen bonding, not electrostatic interactions, to bind double-stranded RNA. Our results provide insights into how an unstructured C-tail contributes to DEAD-box protein activity and suggest parallels with other families of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins.",?,Biochemistry,United States,2017 Jul 18
28467421,A fungal transcription factor essential for starch degradation affects integration of carbon and nitrogen metabolism.,"In Neurospora crassa, the transcription factor COL-26 functions as a regulator of glucose signaling and metabolism. Its loss leads to resistance to carbon catabolite repression. Here, we report that COL-26 is necessary for the expression of amylolytic genes in N. crassa and is required for the utilization of maltose and starch. Additionally, the Deltacol-26 mutant shows growth defects on preferred carbon sources, such as glucose, an effect that was alleviated if glutamine replaced ammonium as the primary nitrogen source. This rescue did not occur when maltose was used as a sole carbon source. Transcriptome and metabolic analyses of the Deltacol-26 mutant relative to its wild type parental strain revealed that amino acid and nitrogen metabolism, the TCA cycle and GABA shunt were adversely affected. Phylogenetic analysis showed a single col-26 homolog in Sordariales, Ophilostomatales, and the Magnaporthales, but an expanded number of col-26 homologs in other filamentous fungal species. Deletion of the closest homolog of col-26 in Trichoderma reesei, bglR, resulted in a mutant with similar preferred carbon source growth deficiency, and which was alleviated if glutamine was the sole nitrogen source, suggesting conservation of COL-26 and BglR function. Our finding provides novel insight into the role of COL-26 for utilization of starch and in integrating carbon and nitrogen metabolism for balanced metabolic activities for optimal carbon and nitrogen distribution.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2017 May
25862648,Membrane transporters in self resistance of Cercospora nicotianae to the photoactivated toxin cercosporin.,"The goal of this work is to characterize membrane transporter genes in Cercospora fungi required for autoresistance to the photoactivated, active-oxygen-generating toxin cercosporin they produce for infection of host plants. Previous studies implicated a role for diverse membrane transporters in cercosporin resistance. In this study, transporters identified in a subtractive cDNA library between a Cercospora nicotianae wild type and a cercosporin-sensitive mutant were characterized, including two ABC transporters (CnATR2, CnATR3), an MFS transporter (CnMFS2), a uracil transporter, and a zinc transport protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that only CnATR3 clustered with transporters previously characterized to be involved in cercosporin resistance. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression under conditions of cercosporin toxicity, however, showed that only CnATR2 was upregulated, thus this gene was selected for further characterization. Transformation and expression of CnATR2 in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus Neurospora crassa significantly increased cercosporin resistance. Targeted gene disruption of CnATR2 in the wild type C. nicotianae, however, did not decrease resistance. Expression analysis of other transporters in the cnatr2 mutant under conditions of cercosporin toxicity showed significant upregulation of the cercosporin facilitator protein gene (CFP), encoding an MFS transporter previously characterized as playing an important role in cercosporin autoresistance in Cercospora species. We conclude that cercosporin autoresistance in Cercospora is mediated by multiple genes, and that the fungus compensates for mutations by up-regulation of other resistance genes. CnATR2 may be a useful gene, alone or in addition to other known resistance genes, for engineering Cercospora resistance in crop plants.","['ABC transporter', 'CRG1', 'CnATR1', 'CnCFP', 'MFS transporter', 'Perylenequinone', 'Photosensitizer resistance', 'Targeted gene disruption']",Current genetics,USA,2015 Nov

In this study, the xylanase transcriptional regulators of Trichoderma reesei (Xyr1) and Neurospora crassa (XLR-1), as well as their constitutively active mutants (Xyr1(A824V) and XLR-1(A828V)), were heterologously expressed in Penicillium oxalicum. The two heterologous regulators were identified to be able to activate lignocellulolytic enzyme gene expression in P. oxalicum. Particularly, expression of T. reesei Xyr1 resulted in a higher cellulase production level compared with the expression of native xylanase transcriptional regulator XlnR using the same promoter. Xyr1(A824V) and XLR-1(A828V) were found to be able to confer P. oxalicum more enhanced lignocellulolytic abilities than wild-type regulators Xyr1 and XLR-1. Furthermore, introduction of regulatory modules containing Xyr1(A824V)/XLR-1(A828V) and their target cellulase genes resulted in greater increases in cellulase production than alone expression of transcriptional regulators. Through the cumulative introduction of three regulatory modules containing regulator mutants and their corresponding target cellulase genes from P. oxalicum, T. reesei, and N. crassa, a 2.8-fold increase in cellulase production was achieved in P. oxalicum.","['Heterologous expression', 'Lignocellulolytic enzyme', 'Penicillium oxalicum', 'Transcription factor', 'XlnR']",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,China,2019 Mar
27210288,Assembly of eIF3 Mediated by Mutually Dependent Subunit Insertion.,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), an essential multi-protein complex involved in translation initiation, is composed of 12 tightly associated subunits in humans. While the overall structure of eIF3 is known, the mechanism of its assembly and structural consequences of dysregulation of eIF3 subunit expression seen in many cancers is largely unknown. Here we show that subunits in eIF3 assemble into eIF3 in an interdependent manner. Assembly of eIF3 is governed primarily by formation of a helical bundle, composed of helices extending C-terminally from PCI-MPN domains in eight subunits. We propose that, while the minimal subcomplex of human-like eIF3 functional for translation initiation in cells consists of subunits a, b, c, f, g, i, and m, numerous other eIF3 subcomplexes exist under circumstances of subunit over- or underexpression. Thus, eIF3 subcomplexes formed or ""released"" due to dysregulated subunit expression may be determining factors contributing to eIF3-related cancers.",?,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",USA,2016 Jun 7

24342650,Transcription factor CCG-8 as a new regulator in the adaptation to antifungal azole stress.,"Antifungal azoles are widely used for controlling fungal infections. Fungi are able to change the expression of many genes when they adapt to azole stress, and increased expression of some of these genes can elevate resistance to azoles. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind transcriptional adaption to azoles in filamentous fungi are poorly understood. In this study, we found that deletion of the transcription factor gene ccg-8, which is known to be a clock-controlled gene, made Neurospora crassa hypersensitive to azoles. A comparative genome-wide analysis of the responses to ketoconazole of the wild type and the ccg-8 mutant revealed that the transcriptional responses to ketoconazole of 78 of the 488 transcriptionally ketoconazole-upregulated genes and the 427 transcriptionally ketoconazole-downregulated genes in the wild type were regulated by CCG-8. Ketoconazole sensitivity testing of all available knockout mutants for CCG-8-regulated genes revealed that CCG-8 contributed to azole adaption by regulating the ketoconazole responses of many genes, including the target gene (erg11), an azole transporter gene (cdr4), a hexose transporter gene (hxt13), a stress response gene (locus number NCU06317, named kts-1), two transcription factor genes (NCU01386 [named kts-2] and fsd-1/ndt80), four enzyme-encoding genes, and six unknown-function genes. CCG-8 also regulated phospholipid synthesis in N. crassa in a manner similar to that of its homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Opi1p. However, there was no cross talk between phospholipid synthesis and azole resistance in N. crassa. CCG-8 homologs are conserved and are common in filamentous fungi. Deletion of the CCG-8 homolog-encoding gene in Fusarium verticillioides (Fvccg-8) also made this fungus hypersensitive to antifungal azoles.",?,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,China,2014

While the phenomenon of MSUD is well recognized, the process that detects unpaired DNA is poorly understood. In this report, we provide two lines of evidence linking unpaired DNA detection to a physical search for DNA homology. First, we have found that a putative SNF2-family protein (SAD-6) is required for efficient MSUD in Neurospora crassa. SAD-6 is closely related to Rad54, a protein known to facilitate key steps in the repair of double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. Second, we have successfully masked unpaired DNA by placing identical transgenes at slightly different locations on homologous chromosomes. This masking falls apart when the distance between the transgenes is increased. We propose a model where unpaired DNA detection during MSUD is achieved through a spatially constrained search for DNA homology. The identity of SAD-6 as a Rad54 paralog suggests that this process may be similar to the searching mechanism used during homologous recombination.","['RNA silencing', 'Rad54', 'chromosome pairing', 'homologous recombination', 'meiosis']",Genetics,Illinois 61790,2014 Nov
24728191,"Phosphate starvation in fungi induces the replacement of phosphatidylcholine with the phosphorus-free betaine lipid diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine.","Diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS) is a phosphorus-free betaine-lipid analog of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesized by many soil bacteria, algae, and nonvascular plants. Synthesis of DGTS and other phosphorus-free lipids in bacteria occurs in response to phosphorus (P) deprivation and results in the replacement of phospholipids by nonphosphorous lipids. The genes encoding DGTS biosynthetic enzymes have previously been identified and characterized in bacteria and the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We now report that many fungal genomes, including those of plant and animal pathogens, encode the enzymatic machinery for DGTS biosynthesis, and that fungi synthesize DGTS during P limitation. This finding demonstrates that replacement of phospholipids by nonphosphorous lipids is a strategy used in divergent eukaryotic lineages for the conservation of P under P-limiting conditions. Mutants of Neurospora crassa were used to show that DGTS synthase encoded by the BTA1 gene is solely responsible for DGTS biosynthesis and is under the control of the fungal phosphorus deprivation regulon, mediated by the NUC-1/Pho4p transcription factor. Furthermore, we describe the rational reengineering of lipid metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such that PtdCho is completely replaced by DGTS, and demonstrate that essential processes of membrane biogenesis and organelle assembly are functional and support growth in the engineered strain.",?,Eukaryotic cell,USA wriekhof2@unl.edu,2014 Jun
29503207,Snapshots of C-S Cleavage in Egt2 Reveals Substrate Specificity and Reaction Mechanism.,"Sulfur incorporation in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine, a histidine thiol derivative, differs from other well-characterized transsulfurations. A combination of a mononuclear non-heme iron enzyme-catalyzed oxidative C-S bond formation and a subsequent pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-mediated C-S lyase reaction leads to the net transfer of a sulfur atom from a cysteine to a histidine. In this study, we structurally and mechanistically characterized a PLP-dependent C-S lyase Egt2, which mediates the sulfoxide C-S bond cleavage in ergothioneine biosynthesis. A cation-pi interaction between substrate and enzyme accounts for Egt2's preference of sulfoxide over thioether as a substrate. Using mutagenesis and structural biology, we captured three distinct states of the Egt2 C-S lyase reaction cycle, including a labile sulfenic intermediate captured in Egt2 crystals. Chemical trapping and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to confirm the involvement of the sulfenic acid intermediate in Egt2 catalysis.","['C-S bond cleavage', 'X-ray crystallography', 'biosynthetic pathway', 'chemical trapping', 'enzymology', 'ergothioneine']",Cell chemical biology,USA,2018 May 17
24070552,Targets of light signalling in Trichoderma reesei.,"BACKGROUND: The tropical ascomycete Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) represents one of the most efficient plant cell wall degraders. Regulation of the enzymes required for this process is affected by nutritional signals as well as other environmental signals including light. RESULTS: Our transcriptome analysis of strains lacking the photoreceptors BLR1 and BLR2 as well as ENV1 revealed a considerable increase in the number of genes showing significantly different transcript levels in light and darkness compared to wild-type. We show that members of all glycoside hydrolase families can be subject to light dependent regulation, hence confirming nutrient utilization including plant cell wall degradation as a major output pathway of light signalling. In contrast to N. crassa, photoreceptor mediated regulation of carbon metabolism in T. reesei occurs primarily by BLR1 and BLR2 via their positive effect on induction of env1 transcription, rather than by a presumed negative effect of ENV1 on the function of the BLR complex. Nevertheless, genes consistently regulated by photoreceptors in N. crassa and T. reesei are significantly enriched in carbon metabolic functions. Hence, different regulatory mechanisms are operative in these two fungi, while the light dependent regulation of plant cell wall degradation appears to be conserved.Analysis of growth on different carbon sources revealed that the oxidoreductive D-galactose and pentose catabolism is influenced by light and ENV1. Transcriptional regulation of the target enzymes in these pathways is enhanced by light and influenced by ENV1, BLR1 and/or BLR2. Additionally we detected an ENV1-regulated genomic cluster of 9 genes including the D-mannitol dehydrogenase gene lxr1, with two genes of this cluster showing consistent regulation in N. crassa. CONCLUSIONS: We show that one major output pathway of light signalling in Trichoderma reesei is regulation of glycoside hydrolase genes and the degradation of hemicellulose building blocks. Targets of ENV1 and BLR1/BLR2 are for the most part distinct and indicate individual functions for ENV1 and the BLR complex besides their postulated regulatory interrelationship.",?,BMC genomics,Austria. monika.schmoll@ait.ac.at,2013 Sep 26
25361767,Cellulose surface degradation by a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase and its effect on cellulase hydrolytic efficiency.,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) represents a unique principle of oxidative degradation of recalcitrant insoluble polysaccharides. Used in combination with hydrolytic enzymes, LPMO appears to constitute a significant factor of the efficiency of enzymatic biomass depolymerization. LPMO activity on different cellulose substrates has been shown from the slow release of oxidized oligosaccharides into solution, but an immediate and direct demonstration of the enzyme action on the cellulose surface is lacking. Specificity of LPMO for degrading ordered crystalline and unordered amorphous cellulose material of the substrate surface is also unknown. We show by fluorescence dye adsorption analyzed with confocal laser scanning microscopy that a LPMO (from Neurospora crassa) introduces carboxyl groups primarily in surface-exposed crystalline areas of the cellulosic substrate. Using time-resolved in situ atomic force microscopy we further demonstrate that cellulose nano-fibrils exposed on the surface are degraded into shorter and thinner insoluble fragments. Also using atomic force microscopy, we show that prior action of LPMO enables cellulases to attack otherwise highly resistant crystalline substrate areas and that it promotes an overall faster and more complete surface degradation. Overall, this study reveals key characteristics of LPMO action on the cellulose surface and suggests the effects of substrate morphology on the synergy between LPMO and hydrolytic enzymes in cellulose depolymerization.","['Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)', 'Biofuel', 'Cellulase', 'Cellulose', 'Copper Monooxygenase', 'GH61-AA9', 'Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase (LPMO)', 'Oxidative Cellulose Surface Degradation', 'Synergy']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Austria,2014 Dec 26
25429045,The histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase DIM-5 modifies chromatin at frequency and represses light-activated gene expression.,"The transcriptional program controlling the circadian rhythm requires coordinated regulation of chromatin. Characterization of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding enzyme CHD1 revealed DNA methylation in the promoter of the central clock gene frequency (frq) in Neurospora crassa. In this report, we show that the DNA methylation at frq is not only dependent on the DNA methyltransferase DIM-2 but also on the H3K9 methyltransferase DIM-5 and HP1. Histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) occurs at frq and is most prominent 30 min after light-activated expression. Strains lacking dim-5 have an increase in light-induced transcription, and more White Collar-2 is found associated with the frq promoter. Consistent with the notion that DNA methylation assists in establishing the proper circadian phase, loss of H3K9 methylation results in a phase advance suggesting it delays the onset of frq expression. The dim-5 deletion strain displays an increase in circadian-regulated conidia formation on race tubes and there is a synthetic genetic interaction between dim-5 and ras-1(bd). These results indicate DIM-5 has a regulatory role in muting circadian output. Overall, the data support a model where facultative heterochromatic at frq serves to establish the appropriate phase, mute the light response, and repress circadian output.","['DNA methylation', 'chromatin', 'circadian rhythm', 'heterochromatin']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",New Jersey 08901,2014 Nov 25

Filamentous fungal genomes contain large repertoires of genes encoding for proteins with similar architecture to plant and animal NLRs with mostly unknown function. Here, we identify and molecularly characterize patatin-like phospholipase-1 (PLP-1), an NLR-like protein containing an N-terminal patatin-like phospholipase domain, a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. PLP-1 guards the essential SNARE protein SEC-9; genetic differences at plp-1 and sec-9 function to trigger allorecognition and cell death in two distantly related fungal species, Neurospora crassa and Podospora anserina Analyses of Neurospora population samples revealed that plp-1 and sec-9 alleles are highly polymorphic, segregate into discrete haplotypes, and show transspecies polymorphism. Upon fusion between cells bearing incompatible sec-9 and plp-1 alleles, allorecognition and cell death are induced, which are dependent upon physical interaction between SEC-9 and PLP-1. The central NBD and patatin-like phospholipase activity of PLP-1 are essential for allorecognition and cell death, while the TPR domain and the polymorphic SNARE domain of SEC-9 function in conferring allelic specificity. Our data indicate that fungal NLR-like proteins function similar to NLR immune receptors in plants and animals, showing that NLRs are major contributors to innate immunity in plants and animals and for allorecognition in fungi.","['NOD-like receptors', 'Neurospora', 'Podospora', 'SEC-9 SNARE', 'allorecognition']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CA 94720-3102,2018 Mar 6

We used phylogenetic analysis to identify P. fijiensis homologs (PKS8-4 and Hybrid8-3) to the PKS4 polyketide synthases (PKS) from Neurospora crassa and Sordaria macrospora involved in sexual reproduction. These sequences also formed a clade with lovastatin, compactin, and betaenone-producing PKS sequences. Transcriptome analysis showed that both the P. fijiensis Hybrid8-3 and PKS8-4 genes have higher expression in infected leaf tissue compared to in culture. Domain analysis showed that PKS8-4 is more similar than Hybrid8-3 to PKS4. pPKS8-4:GFP transcriptional fusion transformants showed expression of GFP in flask-shaped structures in mycelial cultures as well as in crosses between compatible and incompatible mating types. Confocal microscopy confirmed expression in spermagonia in leaf substomatal cavities, consistent with a role in sexual reproduction. A disruption mutant of pks8-4 retained normal pathogenicity on banana, and no differences were observed in growth, conidial production, and spermagonia production. GC-MS profiling of the mutant and wild type did not identify differences in polyketide metabolites, but did identify changes in saturated fatty acid methyl esters and alkene and alkane derivatives.

26537359,Loss of HP1 causes depletion of H3K27me3 from facultative heterochromatin and gain of H3K27me2 at constitutive heterochromatin.,"Methylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me) marks repressed ""facultative heterochromatin,"" including developmentally regulated genes in plants and animals. The mechanisms responsible for localization of H3K27me are largely unknown, perhaps in part because of the complexity of epigenetic regulatory networks. We used a relatively simple model organism bearing both facultative and constitutive heterochromatin, Neurospora crassa, to explore possible interactions between elements of heterochromatin. In higher eukaryotes, reductions of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation in constitutive heterochromatin have been variously reported to cause redistribution of H3K27me3. In Neurospora, we found that elimination of any member of the DCDC H3K9 methylation complex caused massive changes in the distribution of H3K27me; regions of facultative heterochromatin lost H3K27me3, while regions that are normally marked by H3K9me3 became methylated at H3K27. Elimination of DNA methylation had no obvious effect on the distribution of H3K27me. Elimination of HP1, which ""reads"" H3K9me3, also caused major changes in the distribution of H3K27me, indicating that HP1 is important for normal localization of facultative heterochromatin. Because loss of HP1 caused redistribution of H3K27me2/3, but not H3K9me3, these normally nonoverlapping marks became superimposed. Indeed, mass spectrometry revealed substantial cohabitation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me2 on H3 molecules from an hpo strain. Loss of H3K27me machinery (e.g., the methyltransferase SET-7) did not impact constitutive heterochromatin but partially rescued the slow growth of the DCDC mutants, suggesting that the poor growth of these mutants is partly attributable to ectopic H3K27me. Altogether, our findings with Neurospora clarify interactions of facultative and constitutive heterochromatin in eukaryotes.",?,Genome research,USA,2016 Jan
33411405,Insights into the H(2) O(2) -driven catalytic mechanism of fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases.,"Fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) depolymerise crystalline cellulose and hemicellulose, supporting the utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for biorefinery and biomanufacturing processes. Recent investigations have shown that H(2) O(2) is the most efficient cosubstrate for LPMOs. Understanding the reaction mechanism of LPMOs with H(2) O(2) is therefore of importance for their use in biotechnological settings. Here, we have employed a variety of spectroscopic and biochemical approaches to probe the reaction of the fungal LPMO9C from N. crassa using H(2) O(2) as a cosubstrate and xyloglucan as a polysaccharide substrate. We show that a single 'priming' electron transfer reaction from the cellobiose dehydrogenase partner protein supports up to 20 H(2) O(2) -driven catalytic cycles of a fungal LPMO. Using rapid mixing stopped-flow spectroscopy, alongside electron paramagnetic resonance and UV-Vis spectroscopy, we reveal how H(2) O(2) and xyloglucan interact with the enzyme and investigate transient species that form uncoupled pathways of NcLPMO9C. Our study shows how the H(2) O(2) cosubstrate supports fungal LPMO catalysis and leaves the enzyme in the reduced Cu(+) state following a single enzyme turnover, thus preventing the need for external protons and electrons from reducing agents or cellobiose dehydrogenase and supporting the binding of H(2) O(2) for further catalytic steps. We observe that the presence of the substrate xyloglucan stabilises the Cu(+) state of LPMOs, which may prevent the formation of uncoupled side reactions.","['biomass degradation', 'cellobiose dehydrogenase', 'electron paramagnetic resonance', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'type II copper protein']",The FEBS journal,UK,2021 Jul

29170445,A novel bi-domain plant defensin MtDef5 with potent broad-spectrum antifungal activity binds to multiple phospholipids and forms oligomers.,"Defensins are cysteine-rich cationic antimicrobial peptides contributing to the innate immunity in plants. A unique gene encoding a highly cationic bi-domain defensin MtDef5 has been identified in a model legume Medicago truncatula. MtDef5 consists of two defensin domains of 50 amino acids each linked by a 7-amino acid peptide. It exhibits broad-spectrum antifungal activity against filamentous fungi at submicromolar concentrations. It rapidly permeabilizes the plasma membrane of the ascomycete fungi Fusarium graminearum and Neurospora crassa and induces accumulation of reactive oxygen species. It is internalized by these fungi, but uses spatially distinct modes of entry into these fungi. It co-localizes with cellular membranes, travels to nucleus and becomes dispersed in other subcellular locations. It binds to several membrane-resident phospholipids with preference for phosphatidylinositol monophosphates and forms oligomers. Mutations of the cationic amino acids present in the two gamma-core motifs of this defensin that eliminate oligomerization also knockout its ability to induce membrane permeabilization and fungal growth arrest. MtDef5 is the first bi-domain plant defensin that exhibits potent broad-spectrum antifungal activity, recruits multiple membrane phospholipids and forms oligomers in their presence. These findings raise the possibility that MtDef5 might be useful as a novel antifungal agent in transgenic crops.",?,Scientific reports,USA,2017 Nov 23
23844185,Optimization of CDT-1 and XYL1 expression for balanced co-production of ethanol and xylitol from cellobiose and xylose by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Production of ethanol and xylitol from lignocellulosic hydrolysates is an alternative to the traditional production of ethanol in utilizing biomass. However, the conversion efficiency of xylose to xylitol is restricted by glucose repression, causing a low xylitol titer. To this end, we cloned genes CDT-1 (encoding a cellodextrin transporter) and gh1-1 (encoding an intracellular beta-glucosidase) from Neurospora crassa and XYL1 (encoding a xylose reductase that converts xylose into xylitol) from Scheffersomyces stipitis into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enabling simultaneous production of ethanol and xylitol from a mixture of cellobiose and xylose (main components of lignocellulosic hydrolysates). We further optimized the expression levels of CDT-1 and XYL1 by manipulating their promoters and copy-numbers, and constructed an engineered S. cerevisiae strain (carrying one copy of PGK1p-CDT1 and two copies of TDH3p-XYL1), which showed an 85.7% increase in xylitol production from the mixture of cellobiose and xylose than that from the mixture of glucose and xylose. Thus, we achieved a balanced co-fermentation of cellobiose (0.165 g/L/h) and xylose (0.162 g/L/h) at similar rates to co-produce ethanol (0.36 g/g) and xylitol (1.00 g/g).",?,PloS one,PR China,2013
25567623,Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model for the study of extranuclear functions of mammalian telomerase.,"The experimental evidence from the last decade made telomerase a prominent member of a family of moonlighting proteins performing different functions at various cellular loci. However, the study of extratelomeric functions of the catalytic subunit of mammalian telomerase (TERT) is often complicated by the fact that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them from its role(s) at the chromosomal ends. Here, we present an experimental model for studying the extranuclear function(s) of mammalian telomerase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the catalytic subunit of mammalian telomerase protects the yeast cells against oxidative stress and affects the stability of the mitochondrial genome. The advantage of using S. cerevisiae to study of mammalian telomerase is that (1) mammalian TERT does not interfere with its yeast counterpart in the maintenance of telomeres, (2) yeast telomerase is not localized in mitochondria and (3) it does not seem to be involved in the protection of cells against oxidative stress and stabilization of mtDNA. Thus, yeast cells can be used as a 'test tube' for reconstitution of mammalian TERT extranuclear function(s).","['Mitochondria', 'Oxidative stress', 'Telomerase', 'Yeast']",Current genetics,Slovak Republic,2015 Nov
29374564,Structural investigation of cellobiose dehydrogenase IIA: Insights from small angle scattering into intra- and intermolecular electron transfer mechanisms.,"BACKGROUND: Cellobiose dehydrogenases have gained interest due to their potential applications in sectors from biofuel production to biomedical devices. The CDHIIA variant is comprised of a cytochrome domain (CYT), a dehydrogenase domain (DH), and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) that are connected by two flexible linkers. Upon cellobiose oxidation at the DH, intramolecular electron transfer (IaET) occurs from the DH to the CYT. In vivo, CDHIIA CYT subsequently performs intermolecular electron transfer (IeET) to a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO). The relevant solution-state CDH domain conformations for IaET and IeET have not been fully characterized. METHODS: Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering measurements of oxidized CDHIIA from Myriococcum thermophilum and Neurospora crassa were performed to investigate the structural landscape explored in solution by MtCDHIIA and NcCDHIIA in response to cations, pH, and the presence of an electron acceptor, LPMO9D from N. crassa. RESULTS: The scattering data complemented by modeling show that, under oxidizing conditions, MtCDHIIA undergoes global conformational rearrangement in the presence of Ca(2+). Oxidized NcCDHIIA exhibits conformational changes upon pH variation and, in the presence of NcLPMO9D, primarily adopts a compact conformation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate different conformational responses of oxidized MtCDHIIA and NcCDHIIA to changes in environment. The results also reveal a shift in the oxidized NcCDHIIA conformational landscape toward interdomain compaction upon co-incubation with NcLPMO9D.

26996506,Fungal Biomineralization of Manganese as a Novel Source of Electrochemical Materials.,"Electrical energy storage systems such as rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) and supercapacitors have shown great promise as sustainable energy storage systems [1-4]. However, LiBs have high specific energy density (energy stored per unit mass) and act as slow, steady suppliers for large energy demands. In contrast, supercapacitors possess high specific power (energy transferred per unit mass per unit time) and can charge and discharge quickly for low energy demands. In LiBs, graphite is the most common anode material, although high electrolyte sensitivity and low charge capacity can limit performance. Efforts have been made to improve LiB or supercapacitor performance using alternative electrode materials such as carbon nanotubes and manganese oxides (MnxOy) [3, 5-14]. Microorganisms play significant roles in metal and mineral biotransformations [15-22]. Fungi possess various biomineralization properties, as well as a filamentous mycelium, which may provide mechanical support for mineral deposition. Although some research has been carried out on the application of biological materials as carbon precursors [8, 9, 23], biomineralizing fungal systems have not been investigated. In this research, novel electrochemical materials have been synthesized using a fungal Mn biomineralization process based on urease-mediated Mn carbonate bioprecipitation [24]. The carbonized fungal biomass-mineral composite (MycMnOx/C) showed a high specific capacitance (>350 F g(-1)) in a supercapacitor and excellent cycling stability (>90% capacity was retained after 200 cycles) in LiBs.

24520960,An in vitro peptide complementation assay for CYT-18-dependent group I intron splicing reveals a new role for the N-terminus.,"The mitochondrial tyrosyl tRNA synthetase from Neurospora crassa (CYT-18 protein) is a bifunctional group I intron splicing cofactor. CYT-18 is capable of splicing multiple group I introns from a wide variety of sources by stabilizing the catalytically active intron structures. CYT-18 and mt TyrRSs from related fungal species have evolved to assist in group I intron splicing in part by the accumulation of three N-terminal domain insertions. Biochemical and structural analysis indicate that the N-terminal insertions serve primarily to create a structure-stabilizing scaffold for critical tertiary interactions between the two major RNA domains of group I introns. Previous studies concluded that the primarily alpha-helical N-terminal insertion, H0, contributes to protein stability and is necessary for splicing the N. crassa ND1 intron but is dispensable for splicing the N. crassa mitochondrial LSU intron. Here, we show that CYT-18 with a complete H0 deletion retains residual ND1 intron splicing activity and that addition of the missing N-terminus in trans is capable of restoring a significant portion of its splicing activity. The development of this peptide complementation assay has allowed us to explore important characteristics of the CYT-18/group I intron interaction including the stoichiometry of H0 in intron splicing and the importance of specific H0 residues. Evaluation of truncated H0 peptides in this assay and a re-examination of the CYT-18 crystal structure suggest a previously unknown structural role of the first five N-terminal residues of CYT-18. These residues interact directly with another splicing insertion, making H0 a central structural element responsible for connecting all three N-terminal splicing insertions.",?,Biochemistry,United States,2014 Mar 4
27870869,"Glucose Starvation Alters Heat Shock Response, Leading to Death of Wild Type Cells and Survival of MAP Kinase Signaling Mutant.","A moderate heat shock induces Neurospora crassa to synthesize large quantities of heat shock proteins that are protective against higher, otherwise lethal temperatures. However, wild type cells do not survive when carbohydrate deprivation is added to heat shock. In contrast, a mutant strain defective in a stress-activated protein kinase does survive the combined stresses. In order to understand the basis for this difference in survival, we have determined the relative levels of detected proteins in the mutant and wild type strain during dual stress, and we have identified gene transcripts in both strains whose quantities change in response to heat shock or dual stress. These data and supportive experimental evidence point to reasons for survival of the mutant strain. By using alternative respiratory mechanisms, these cells experience less of the oxidative stress that proves damaging to wild type cells. Of central importance, mutant cells recycle limited resources during dual stress by undergoing autophagy, a process that we find utilized by both wild type and mutant cells during heat shock. Evidence points to inappropriate activation of TORC1, the central metabolic regulator, in wild type cells during dual stress, based upon behavior of an additional signaling mutant and inhibitor studies.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2016

25978382,Biological Significance of Photoreceptor Photocycle Length: VIVID Photocycle Governs the Dynamic VIVID-White Collar Complex Pool Mediating Photo-adaptation and Response to Changes in Light Intensity.,"Most organisms on earth sense light through the use of chromophore-bearing photoreceptive proteins with distinct and characteristic photocycle lengths, yet the biological significance of this adduct decay length is neither understood nor has been tested. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa VIVID (VVD) is a critical player in the process of photoadaptation, the attenuation of light-induced responses and the ability to maintain photosensitivity in response to changing light intensities. Detailed in vitro analysis of the photochemistry of the blue light sensing, FAD binding, LOV domain of VVD has revealed residues around the site of photo-adduct formation that influence the stability of the adduct state (light state), that is, altering the photocycle length. We have examined the biological significance of VVD photocycle length to photoadaptation and report that a double substitution mutant (vvdI74VI85V), previously shown to have a very fast light to dark state reversion in vitro, shows significantly reduced interaction with the White Collar Complex (WCC) resulting in a substantial photoadaptation defect. This reduced interaction impacts photoreceptor transcription factor WHITE COLLAR-1 (WC-1) protein stability when N. crassa is exposed to light: The fast-reverting mutant VVD is unable to form a dynamic VVD-WCC pool of the size required for photoadaptation as assayed both by attenuation of gene expression and the ability to respond to increasing light intensity. Additionally, transcription of the clock gene frequency (frq) is sensitive to changing light intensity in a wild-type strain but not in the fast photo-reversion mutant indicating that the establishment of this dynamic VVD-WCC pool is essential in general photobiology and circadian biology. Thus, VVD photocycle length appears sculpted to establish a VVD-WCC reservoir of sufficient size to sustain photoadaptation while maintaining sensitivity to changing light intensity. The great diversity in photocycle kinetics among photoreceptors may be viewed as reflecting adaptive responses to specific and salient tasks required by organisms to respond to different photic environments.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2015 May
29134709,Light sensing by opsins and fungal ecology: NOP-1 modulates entry into sexual reproduction in response to environmental cues.,"Understanding the genetic basis of the switch from asexual to sexual lifestyles in response to sometimes rapid environmental changes is one of the major challenges in fungal ecology. Light appears to play a critical role in the asexual-sexual switch-but fungal genomes harbour diverse light sensors. Fungal opsins are homologous to bacterial green-light-sensory rhodopsins, and their organismal functions in fungi have not been well understood. Three of these opsin-like proteins were widely distributed across fungal genomes, but homologs of the Fusarium opsin-like protein CarO were present only in plant-associated fungi. Key amino acids, including potential retinal binding sites, functionally diverged on the phylogeny of opsins. This diversification of opsin-like proteins could be correlated with life history-associated differences among fungi in their expression and function during morphological development. In Neurospora crassa and related species, knockout of the opsin NOP-1 led to a phenotype in the regulation of the asexual-sexual switch, modulating response to both light and oxygen conditions. Sexual development commenced early in âˆ†nop-1 strains cultured in unsealed plates under constant blue and white light. Furthermore, comparative transcriptomics showed that the expression of nop-1 is light-dependent and that the âˆ†nop-1 strain abundantly expresses genes involved in oxidative stress response, genes enriched in NAD/NADP binding sites, genes with functions in proton transmembrane movement and catalase activity, and genes involved in the homeostasis of protons. Based on these observations, we contend that light and oxidative stress regulate the switch via light-responsive and ROS pathways in model fungus N. crassa and other fungi.","['asexual-sexual switch', 'ecology', 'fungi', 'light response', 'oxidative stress']",Molecular ecology,USA,2018 Jan

Lignocellulose hydrolysis at temperatures above the optimum temperature of T. reesei cellulases (~50 degrees C) could provide many significant advantages, including reduced viscosity at high-solids loadings, lower risk of microbial contamination during saccharification, greater compatibility with high-temperature biomass pretreatment, and faster rates of hydrolysis. These potential advantages motivate efforts to engineer T. reesei cellulases that can hydrolyze lignocellulose at temperatures ranging from 60-70 degrees C. RESULTS: A B-factor guided approach for improving thermostability was used to engineer variants of endoglucanase I (Cel7B) from T. reesei (TrEGI) that are able to hydrolyze cellulosic substrates more rapidly than the recombinant wild-type TrEGI at temperatures ranging from 50-70 degrees C. When expressed in T. reesei, TrEGI variant G230A/D113S/D115T (G230A/D113S/D115T Tr_TrEGI) had a higher apparent melting temperature (3 degrees C increase in Tm) and improved half-life at 60 degrees C (t1/2 = 161 hr) than the recombinant (T. reesei host) wild-type TrEGI (t1/2 = 74 hr at 60 degrees C, Tr_TrEGI). Furthermore, G230A/D113S/D115T Tr_TrEGI showed 2-fold improved activity compared to Tr_TrEGI at 65 degrees C on solid cellulosic substrates, and was as efficient in hydrolyzing cellulose at 60 degrees C as Tr_TrEGI was at 50 degrees C. The activities and stabilities of the recombinant TrEGI enzymes followed similar trends but differed significantly in magnitude depending on the expression host (Escherichia coli cell-free, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, or T. reesei). Compared to N.crassa-expressed TrEGI, S. cerevisiae-expressed TrEGI showed inferior activity and stability, which was attributed to the lack of cyclization of the N-terminal glutamine in Sc_TrEGI and not to differences in glycosylation. N-terminal pyroglutamate formation in TrEGI expressed in S. cerevisiae was found to be essential in elevating its activity and stability to levels similar to the T. reesei or N. crassa-expressed enzyme, highlighting the importance of this ubiquitous modification in GH7 enzymes. CONCLUSION: Structure-guided evolution of T. reesei EGI was used to engineer enzymes with increased thermal stability and activity on solid cellulosic substrates. Production of TrEGI enzymes in four hosts highlighted the impact of the expression host and the role of N-terminal pyroglutamate formation on the activity and stability of TrEGI enzymes.",?,BMC biotechnology,USA. harshal.ucd@gmail.com,2015 Feb 21
36603054,Nutritional compensation of the circadian clock is a conserved process influenced by gene expression regulation and mRNA stability.,"Compensation is a defining principle of a true circadian clock, where its approximately 24-hour period length is relatively unchanged across environmental conditions. Known compensation effectors directly regulate core clock factors to buffer the oscillator's period length from variables in the environment. Temperature Compensation mechanisms have been experimentally addressed across circadian model systems, but much less is known about the related process of Nutritional Compensation, where circadian period length is maintained across physiologically relevant nutrient levels. Using the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, we performed a genetic screen under glucose and amino acid starvation conditions to identify new regulators of Nutritional Compensation. Our screen uncovered 16 novel mutants, and together with 4 mutants characterized in prior work, a model emerges where Nutritional Compensation of the fungal clock is achieved at the levels of transcription, chromatin regulation, and mRNA stability. However, eukaryotic circadian Nutritional Compensation is completely unstudied outside of Neurospora. To test for conservation in cultured human cells, we selected top hits from our fungal genetic screen, performed siRNA knockdown experiments of the mammalian orthologs, and characterized the cell lines with respect to compensation. We find that the wild-type mammalian clock is also compensated across a large range of external glucose concentrations, as observed in Neurospora, and that knocking down the mammalian orthologs of the Neurospora compensation-associated genes CPSF6 or SETD2 in human cells also results in nutrient-dependent period length changes. We conclude that, like Temperature Compensation, Nutritional Compensation is a conserved circadian process in fungal and mammalian clocks and that it may share common molecular determinants.",?,PLoS biology,United States of America,2023 Jan
25411845,"Fungal communication requires the MAK-2 pathway elements STE-20 and RAS-2, the NRC-1 adapter STE-50 and the MAP kinase scaffold HAM-5.","Intercellular communication is critical for the survival of unicellular organisms as well as for the development and function of multicellular tissues. Cell-to-cell signaling is also required to develop the interconnected mycelial network characteristic of filamentous fungi and is a prerequisite for symbiotic and pathogenic host colonization achieved by molds. Somatic cell-cell communication and subsequent cell fusion is governed by the MAK-2 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in the filamentous ascomycete model Neurospora crassa, yet the composition and mode of regulation of the MAK-2 pathway are currently unclear. In order to identify additional components involved in MAK-2 signaling we performed affinity purification experiments coupled to mass spectrometry with strains expressing functional GFP-fusion proteins of the MAPK cascade. This approach identified STE-50 as a regulatory subunit of the Ste11p homolog NRC-1 and HAM-5 as cell-communication-specific scaffold protein of the MAPK cascade. Moreover, we defined a network of proteins consisting of two Ste20-related kinases, the small GTPase RAS-2 and the adenylate cyclase capping protein CAP-1 that function upstream of the MAK-2 pathway and whose signals converge on the NRC-1/STE-50 MAP3K complex and the HAM-5 scaffold. Finally, our data suggest an involvement of the striatin interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, the casein kinase 2 heterodimer, the phospholipid flippase modulators YPK-1 and NRC-2 and motor protein-dependent vesicle trafficking in the regulation of MAK-2 pathway activity and function. Taken together, these data will have significant implications for our mechanistic understanding of MAPK signaling and for homotypic cell-cell communication in fungi and higher eukaryotes.",?,PLoS genetics,Germany,2014 Nov
28507141,Pulses of Ca(2+) coordinate actin assembly and exocytosis for stepwise cell extension.,"Many eukaryotic cells grow by extending their cell periphery in pulses. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not yet fully understood. Here we present a comprehensive model of stepwise cell extension by using the unique tip growth system of filamentous fungi. Live-cell imaging analysis, including superresolution microscopy, revealed that the fungus Aspergillus nidulans extends the hyphal tip in an oscillatory manner. The amount of F-actin and secretory vesicles (SV) accumulating at the hyphal tip oscillated with a positive temporal correlation, whereas vesicle amounts were negatively correlated to the growth rate. The intracellular Ca(2+) level also pulsed with a positive temporal correlation to the amount of F-actin and SV at the hyphal tip. Two Ca(2+) channels, MidA and CchA, were needed for proper tip growth and the oscillations of actin polymerization, exocytosis, and the growth rate. The data indicate a model in which transient Ca(2+) pluses cause depolymerization of F-actin at the cortex and promote SV fusion with the plasma membrane, thereby extending the cell tip. Over time, Ca(2+) diffuses away and F-actin and SV accumulate again at the hyphal tip. Our data provide evidence that temporally controlled actin polymerization and exocytosis are coordinated by pulsed Ca(2+) influx, resulting in stepwise cell extension.","['Aspergillus', 'actin', 'calcium', 'filamentous fungi', 'oscillation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Germany; takeshita.norio.gf@u.tsukuba.ac.jp,2017 May 30
27068092,"Identification and Characterization of a Novel Aspergillus fumigatus Rhomboid Family Putative Protease, RbdA, Involved in Hypoxia Sensing and Virulence.","Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common pathogenic mold infecting humans and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, A. fumigatus spores are inhaled into the lungs, undergoing germination and invasive hyphal growth. The fungus occludes and disrupts the blood vessels, leading to hypoxia and eventual tissue necrosis. The ability of this mold to adapt to hypoxia is regulated in part by the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) SrbA and the DscA to DscD Golgi E3 ligase complex critical for SREBP activation by proteolytic cleavage. Loss of the genes encoding these proteins results in avirulence. To identify novel regulators of hypoxia sensing, we screened the Neurospora crassa gene deletion library under hypoxia and identified a novel rhomboid family protease essential for hypoxic growth. Deletion of the A. fumigatus rhomboid homolog rbdA resulted in an inability to grow under hypoxia, hypersensitivity to CoCl2, nikkomycin Z, fluconazole, and ferrozine, abnormal swollen tip morphology, and transcriptional dysregulation-accurately phenocopying deletion of srbA. In vivo, rbdA deletion resulted in increased sensitivity to phagocytic killing, a reduced inflammatory Th1 and Th17 response, and strongly attenuated virulence. Phenotypic rescue of the DeltarbdA mutant was achieved by expression and nuclear localization of the N terminus of SrbA, including its HLH domain, further indicating that RbdA and SrbA act in the same signaling pathway. In summary, we have identified RbdA, a novel putative rhomboid family protease in A. fumigatus that mediates hypoxia adaptation and fungal virulence and that is likely linked to SrbA cleavage and activation.",?,Infection and immunity,Israel,2016 Jun
28425502,Revealing Hidden Conformational Space of LOV Protein VIVID Through Rigid Residue Scan Simulations.,"VIVID(VVD) protein is a Light-Oxygen-Voltage(LOV) domain in circadian clock system. Upon blue light activation, a covalent bond is formed between VVD residue Cys108 and its cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide(FAD), and prompts VVD switching from Dark state to Light state with significant conformational deviation. However, the mechanism of this local environment initiated global protein conformational change remains elusive. We employed a recently developed computational approach, rigid residue scan(RRS), to systematically probe the impact of the internal degrees of freedom in each amino acid residue of VVD on its overall dynamics by applying rigid body constraint on each residue in molecular dynamics simulations. Key residues were identified with distinctive impacts on Dark and Light states, respectively. All the simulations display wide range of distribution on a two-dimensional(2D) plot upon structural root-mean-square deviations(RMSD) from either Dark or Light state. Clustering analysis of the 2D RMSD distribution leads to 15 representative structures with drastically different conformation of N-terminus, which is also a key difference between Dark and Light states of VVD. Further principle component analyses(PCA) of RRS simulations agree with the observation of distinctive impact from individual residues on Dark and Light states.",?,Scientific reports,United States of America,2017 Apr 20
27152023,Interactions of a fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase with beta-glucan substrates and cellobiose dehydrogenase.,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-dependent enzymes that catalyze oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds using molecular oxygen and an external electron donor. We have used NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to study the interactions of a broad-specificity fungal LPMO, NcLPMO9C, with various substrates and with cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), a known natural supplier of electrons. The NMR studies revealed interactions with cellohexaose that center around the copper site. NMR studies with xyloglucans, i.e., branched beta-glucans, showed an extended binding surface compared with cellohexaose, whereas ITC experiments showed slightly higher affinity and a different thermodynamic signature of binding. The ITC data also showed that although the copper ion alone hardly contributes to affinity, substrate binding is enhanced for metal-loaded enzymes that are supplied with cyanide, a mimic of O2 (-) Studies with CDH and its isolated heme b cytochrome domain unambiguously showed that the cytochrome domain of CDH interacts with the copper site of the LPMO and that substrate binding precludes interaction with CDH. Apart from providing insights into enzyme-substrate interactions in LPMOs, the present observations shed new light on possible mechanisms for electron supply during LPMO action.","['LPMO', 'cellobiose dehydrogenase', 'cellulose', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'xyloglucan']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Norway,2016 May 24

Blue light converts VIVID from the dark state into the light state (VVDL) with concomitant homodimerization. Upon return to low-light conditions, VVD very slowly reverts back into the monomeric dark state (VVDD). To better understand the nature of the conformational changes that are the basis for the light-dark switch in VVD, we used hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to probe solvent accessibility of backbone amide protons. Our data demonstrate that all structural elements of VVDD except for the N-cap region exchange according to the rare EX1 mechanism indicating a reversible unfolding with rather slow refolding rate. Interestingly, the unfolding halftimes of different elements were not identical but varied from 400 to 900s. VVDL also exchanges according to the EX1 mechanism, albeit with a halftime of 6h. Surprisingly, the dimerization interface showed very little protection suggesting a rapid dimer-monomer interconversion.","['EX1', 'HX', 'MS', 'PYP', 'circadian regulator', 'conformational equilibrium', 'dynamics', 'hydrogen ((1)H/(2)H) exchange', 'mass spectrometry', 'photoactive yellow protein']",Journal of molecular biology,Germany,2014 Feb 6
24554705,Histone H3K56 acetylation is required for quelling-induced small RNA production through its role in homologous recombination.,"Quelling and DNA damage-induced small RNA (qiRNA) production are RNA interference (RNAi)-related phenomenon from repetitive genomic loci in Neurospora. We have recently proposed that homologous recombination from repetitive DNA loci allows the RNAi pathway to recognize repetitive DNA to produce small RNA. However, the mechanistic detail of this pathway remains largely unclear. By systematically screening the Neurospora knock-out library, we identified RTT109 as a novel component required for small RNA production. RTT109 is a histone acetyltransferase for histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) and H3K56 acetylation is essential for the small RNA biogenesis pathway. Furthermore, we showed that RTT109 is required for homologous recombination and H3K56Ac is enriched around double strand break, which overlaps with RAD51 binding. Taken together, our results suggest that H3K56 acetylation is required for small RNA production through its role in homologous recombination.","['Homologous Recombination', 'Neurospora', 'RNA Interference (RNAi)', 'RNA Silencing', 'siRNA']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Texas 75390,2014 Mar 28

Proper folding of these proteins is monitored by the unfolded protein response and involves protein degradation pathways to ensure quality control. Here, we identify a new pathway for quality control of major facilitator superfamily transporters that occurs before the first transmembrane helix, the signal sequence recognized by the signal recognition particle, is made by the ribosome. Increased rates of translation elongation of the N-terminal sequence of these integral membrane proteins can divert the nascent protein chains to the ribosome-associated complex and stress-seventy subfamily B chaperones. We also show that quality control of integral membrane proteins by ribosome-associated complex-stress-seventy subfamily B couples translation rate to the unfolded protein response, which has implications for understanding mechanisms underlying human disease and protein production in biotechnology.","['chaperone', 'major facilitator superfamily (MFS)', 'membrane protein', 'protein synthesis', 'ribosome associated complex (RAC)', 'stress-seventy subfamily B (Ssb)', 'translation control', 'unfolded protein response (UPR)']",The Journal of biological chemistry,From the Departments of Molecular and Cell Biology and,2017 Dec 1
26587879,Evolutionary Conservation and Diversification of Puf RNA Binding Proteins and Their mRNA Targets.,"Reprogramming of a gene's expression pattern by acquisition and loss of sequences recognized by specific regulatory RNA binding proteins may be a major mechanism in the evolution of biological regulatory programs. We identified that RNA targets of Puf3 orthologs have been conserved over 100-500 million years of evolution in five eukaryotic lineages. Focusing on Puf proteins and their targets across 80 fungi, we constructed a parsimonious model for their evolutionary history. This model entails extensive and coordinated changes in the Puf targets as well as changes in the number of Puf genes and alterations of RNA binding specificity including that: 1) Binding of Puf3 to more than 200 RNAs whose protein products are predominantly involved in the production and organization of mitochondrial complexes predates the origin of budding yeasts and filamentous fungi and was maintained for 500 million years, throughout the evolution of budding yeast. 2) In filamentous fungi, remarkably, more than 150 of the ancestral Puf3 targets were gained by Puf4, with one lineage maintaining both Puf3 and Puf4 as regulators and a sister lineage losing Puf3 as a regulator of these RNAs. The decrease in gene expression of these mRNAs upon deletion of Puf4 in filamentous fungi (N. crassa) in contrast to the increase upon Puf3 deletion in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) suggests that the output of the RNA regulatory network is different with Puf4 in filamentous fungi than with Puf3 in budding yeast. 3) The coregulated Puf4 target set in filamentous fungi expanded to include mitochondrial genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and other nuclear-encoded RNAs with mitochondrial function not bound by Puf3 in budding yeast, observations that provide additional evidence for substantial rewiring of post-transcriptional regulation. 4) Puf3 also expanded and diversified its targets in filamentous fungi, gaining interactions with the mRNAs encoding the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex I as well as hundreds of other mRNAs with nonmitochondrial functions. The many concerted and conserved changes in the RNA targets of Puf proteins strongly support an extensive role of RNA binding proteins in coordinating gene expression, as originally proposed by Keene. Rewiring of Puf-coordinated mRNA targets and transcriptional control of the same genes occurred at different points in evolution, suggesting that there have been distinct adaptations via RNA binding proteins and transcription factors. The changes in Puf targets and in the Puf proteins indicate an integral involvement of RNA binding proteins and their RNA targets in the adaptation, reprogramming, and function of gene expression.",?,PLoS biology,United States of America,2015
25533487,Structural biochemistry of a fungal LOV domain photoreceptor reveals an evolutionarily conserved pathway integrating light and oxidative stress.,"Fungal LOV proteins facilitate photoadaptation via blue light regulation of dimer formation. Despite considerable homology of these proteins in closely related fungi, deviations in signaling exist. Here we report the crystal structure of ENVOY (ENV1), a homolog of N. crassa VVD in the fungus T. reesei, a model organism for plant cell wall degradation. Structural studies contradict a model of reversible competitive dimerization. Rather, evolutionary pressures have facilitated a two-residue shift in the position of a key Cys residue (Cys96) that enables the integration of environmental stress and light responses. A Cys96Thr variant abolishes adaptive responses to light and oxidative stress in a carbon source-dependent manner in vivo. Phylogenetic analysis verifies an evolutionary relevance of the Cys residue shift in different orders within Sordariomycetes. In this manner, we identified a widespread oxidative stress signaling mechanism that couples metabolic sensing and blue light responses not previously identified in LOV proteins.",?,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",USA,2015 Jan 6
24947507,Evidence supporting the 19 beta-strand model for Tom40 from cysteine scanning and protease site accessibility studies.,"Most proteins found in mitochondria are translated in the cytosol and enter the organelle via the TOM complex (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane). Tom40 is the pore forming component of the complex. Although the three-dimensional structure of Tom40 has not been determined, the structure of porin, a related protein, has been shown to be a beta-barrel containing 19 membrane spanning beta-strands and an N-terminal alpha-helical region. The evolutionary relationship between the two proteins has allowed modeling of Tom40 into a similar structure by several laboratories. However, it has been suggested that the 19-strand porin structure does not represent the native form of the protein. If true, modeling of Tom40 based on the porin structure would also be invalid. We have used substituted cysteine accessibility mapping to identify several potential beta-strands in the Tom40 protein in isolated mitochondria. These data, together with protease accessibility studies, support the 19 beta-strand model for Tom40 with the C-terminal end of the protein localized to the intermembrane space.","['Membrane Protein', 'Mitochondria', 'Neurospora', 'Protein Structure', 'SCAM', 'Tom40', 'Transmembrane Domain', 'beta-Barrel Protein']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Canada,2014 Aug 1
25831497,"The frequency natural antisense transcript first promotes, then represses, frequency gene expression via facultative heterochromatin.","The circadian clock is controlled by a network of interconnected feedback loops that require histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. Long noncoding natural antisense transcripts (NATs) originate from Period in mammals and frequency (frq) in Neurospora. To understand the role of NATs in the clock, we put the frq antisense transcript qrf (frq spelled backwards) under the control of an inducible promoter. Replacing the endogenous qrf promoter altered heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation at frq. In addition, constitutive, low-level induction of qrf caused a dramatic effect on the endogenous rhythm and elevated circadian output. Surprisingly, even though qrf is needed for heterochromatic silencing, induction of qrf initially promoted frq gene expression by creating a more permissible local chromatin environment. The observation that antisense expression can initially promote sense gene expression before silencing via heterochromatin formation at convergent loci is also found when a NAT to hygromycin resistance gene is driven off the endogenous vivid (vvd) promoter in the Deltavvd strain. Facultative heterochromatin silencing at frq functions in a parallel pathway to previously characterized VVD-dependent silencing and is needed to establish the appropriate circadian phase. Thus, repression via dicer-independent siRNA-mediated facultative heterochromatin is largely independent of, and occurs alongside, other feedback processes.","['DNA methylation', 'circadian rhythm', 'heterochromatin', 'natural antisense transcripts']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,NJ 08901,2015 Apr 7

One such significant pathway is the cellobiose utilization pathway, identified as a promising route in biomass utilization. Here we describe the optimization of cellobiose consumption and ethanol productivity by simultaneously engineering both proteins of the pathway, the beta-glucosidase (gh1-1) and the cellodextrin transporter (cdt-1), in an example of pathway engineering through directed evolution. RESULTS: The improved pathway was assessed based on the strain specific growth rate on cellobiose, with the final mutant exhibiting a 47% increase over the wild-type pathway. Metabolite analysis of the engineered pathway identified a 49% increase in cellobiose consumption (1.78 to 2.65 g cellobiose/(L . h)) and a 64% increase in ethanol productivity (0.611 to 1.00 g ethanol/(L . h)). CONCLUSIONS: By simultaneously engineering multiple proteins in the pathway, cellobiose utilization in S. cerevisiae was improved. This optimization can be generally applied to other metabolic pathways, provided a selection/screening method is available for the desired phenotype. The improved in vivo cellobiose utilization demonstrated here could help to decrease the in vitro enzyme load in biomass pretreatment, ultimately contributing to a reduction in the high cost of biofuel production.",?,Microbial cell factories,,2013 Jun 26
29364205,Live-cell Imaging of Fungal Cells to Investigate Modes of Entry and Subcellular Localization of Antifungal Plant Defensins.,"Small cysteine-rich defensins are one of the largest groups of host defense peptides present in all plants. Many plant defensins exhibit potent in vitro antifungal activity against a broad-spectrum of fungal pathogens and therefore have the potential to be used as antifungal agents in transgenic crops. In order to harness the full potential of plant defensins for diseases control, it is crucial to elucidate their mechanisms of action (MOA). With the advent of advanced microscopy techniques, live-cell imaging has become a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of the antifungal MOA of plant defensins. Here, a confocal microscopy based live-cell imaging method is described using two fluorescently labeled plant defensins (MtDef4 and MtDef5) in combination with vital fluorescent dyes. This technique enables real-time visualization and analysis of the dynamic events of MtDef4 and MtDef5 internalization into fungal cells. Importantly, this assay generates a wealth of information including internalization kinetics, mode of entry and subcellular localization of these peptides.

36537198,Functional analysis of 110 phosphorylation sites on the circadian clock protein FRQ identifies clusters determining period length and temperature compensation.,"In the negative feedback loop driving the Neurospora circadian oscillator, the negative element, FREQUENCY (FRQ), inhibits its own expression by promoting phosphorylation of its heterodimeric transcriptional activators, White Collar-1 (WC-1) and WC-2. FRQ itself also undergoes extensive time-of-day-specific phosphorylation with over 100 phosphosites previously documented. Although disrupting individual or certain clusters of phosphorylation sites has been shown to alter circadian period lengths to some extent, it is still elusive how all the phosphorylations on FRQ control its activity. In this study, we systematically investigated the role in period determination of all 110 reported FRQ phosphorylation sites, using mutagenesis and luciferase reporter assays. Surprisingly, robust FRQ phosphorylation is still detected even when 84 phosphosites were eliminated altogether; further mutating another 26 phosphoresidues completely abolished FRQ phosphorylation. To identify phosphoresidue(s) on FRQ impacting circadian period length, a series of clustered frq phosphomutants covering all the 110 phosphosites were generated and examined for period changes. When phosphosites in the N-terminal and middle regions of FRQ were eliminated, longer periods were typically seen while removal of phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail resulted in extremely short periods, among the shortest reported. Interestingly, abolishing the 11 phosphosites in the C-terminal tail of FRQ not only results in an extremely short period, but also impacts temperature compensation (TC), yielding an overcompensated circadian oscillator. In addition, the few phosphosites in the middle of FRQ are also found to be crucial for TC. When different groups of FRQ phosphomutations were combined intramolecularly, expected additive effects were generally observed except for one novel case of intramolecular epistasis, where arrhythmicity resulting from one cluster of phosphorylation site mutants was restored by eliminating phosphorylation at another group of sites.","['Neurospora', 'FRQ', 'mutants', 'period length', 'phosphorylation', 'temperature compensation']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",USA,2023 Feb 9
24021239,Role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Trk1 in stabilization of intracellular potassium content upon changes in external potassium levels.,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are able to grow at very different potassium concentrations adapting its intracellular cation levels to changes in the external milieu. Potassium homeostasis in wild type cells resuspended in media with low potassium is an example of non-perfect adaptation since the same intracellular concentration is not approached irrespective of the extracellular levels of the cation. By using yeasts lacking the Trk1,2 system or expressing different versions of the mutated main plasma membrane potassium transporter (Trk1), we show that Trk1 is not essential for adaptation to potassium changes but the dynamics of potassium loss is very different in the wild type and in trk1,2 mutant or in yeasts expressing Trk1 versions with highly impaired transport characteristics. We also show that the pattern here described can be also fulfilled by heterologous expression of NcHAK1, a potassium transporter not belonging to the TRK family. Hyperpolarization and cationic drugs sensitivity in mutants with defective transport capacity provide additional support to the hypothesis of connections between the activity of the Trk system and the plasma membrane H(+) ATPase (Pma1) in the adaptive process.","['Intracellular potassium', 'Non-perfect adaptation', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Trk transporter']",Biochimica et biophysica acta,Spain,2014 Jan
27402847,Heat Shock Protein 90 kDa (Hsp90) Has a Second Functional Interaction Site with the Mitochondrial Import Receptor Tom70.,"To accomplish its crucial role, mitochondria require proteins that are produced in the cytosol, delivered by cytosolic Hsp90, and translocated to its interior by the translocase outer membrane (TOM) complex. Hsp90 is a dimeric molecular chaperone and its function is modulated by its interaction with a large variety of co-chaperones expressed within the cell. An important family of co-chaperones is characterized by the presence of one TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) domain, which binds to the C-terminal MEEVD motif of Hsp90. These include Tom70, an important component of the TOM complex. Despite a wealth of studies conducted on the relevance of Tom70.Hsp90 complex formation, there is a dearth of information regarding the exact molecular mode of interaction. To help fill this void, we have employed a combined experimental strategy consisting of cross-linking/mass spectrometry to investigate binding of the C-terminal Hsp90 domain to the cytosolic domain of Tom70. This approach has identified a novel region of contact between C-Hsp90 and Tom70, a finding that is confirmed by probing the corresponding peptides derived from cross-linking experiments via isothermal titration calorimetry and mitochondrial import assays. The data generated in this study are combined to input constraints for a molecular model of the Hsp90/Tom70 interaction, which has been validated by small angle x-ray scattering, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and mass spectrometry. The resultant model suggests that only one of the MEEVD motifs within dimeric Hsp90 contacts Tom70. Collectively, our findings provide significant insight on the mechanisms by which preproteins interact with Hsp90 and are translocated via Tom70 to the mitochondria.","['heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)', 'mitochondrial transport', 'molecular chaperone', 'protein assembly', 'protein folding']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Brazil,2016 Sep 2

By positional cloning based on heat augmented mutagen sensitivity of the nd strain, we identified a nonsense mutation in the msh1 gene, an eukaryotic homolog of bacterial MutS, and this mutation resulted in encoding non-functional polypeptide. By tagging with GFP, subcellular localization of the MSH1 protein in the mitochondria was observed, and knock out of the msh1 gene caused severe growth deficiency accompanying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) aberrations such as large-scale mtDNA deletions and rearrangements as seen in the nd strain.

27148882,Recombination-Independent Recognition of DNA Homology for Repeat-Induced Point Mutation (RIP) Is Modulated by the Underlying Nucleotide Sequence.,"Haploid germline nuclei of many filamentous fungi have the capacity to detect homologous nucleotide sequences present on the same or different chromosomes. Once recognized, such sequences can undergo cytosine methylation or cytosine-to-thymine mutation specifically over the extent of shared homology. In Neurospora crassa this process is known as Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP). Previously, we showed that RIP did not require MEI-3, the only RecA homolog in Neurospora, and that it could detect homologous trinucleotides interspersed with a matching periodicity of 11 or 12 base-pairs along participating chromosomal segments. This pattern was consistent with a mechanism of homology recognition that involved direct interactions between co-aligned double-stranded (ds) DNA molecules, where sequence-specific dsDNA/dsDNA contacts could be established using no more than one triplet per turn. In the present study we have further explored the DNA sequence requirements for RIP. In our previous work, interspersed homologies were always examined in the context of a relatively long adjoining region of perfect homology. Using a new repeat system lacking this strong interaction, we now show that interspersed homologies with overall sequence identity of only 36% can be efficiently detected by RIP in the absence of any perfect homology. Furthermore, in this new system, where the total amount of homology is near the critical threshold required for RIP, the nucleotide composition of participating DNA molecules is identified as an important factor. Our results specifically pinpoint the triplet 5'-GAC-3' as a particularly efficient unit of homology recognition. Finally, we present experimental evidence that the process of homology sensing can be uncoupled from the downstream mutation. Taken together, our results advance the notion that sequence information can be compared directly between double-stranded DNA molecules during RIP and, potentially, in other processes where homologous pairing of intact DNA molecules is observed.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2016 May
27317785,Crosses Heterozygous for Hybrid Neurospora Translocation Strains Show Transmission Ratio Distortion Disfavoring Homokaryotic Ascospores Made Following Alternate Segregation.,"By introgressing Neurospora crassa translocations into N. tetrasperma, we constructed heterokaryons bearing haploid nuclei of opposite mating types, and either the translocation and normal sequence chromosomes (i.e., [T + N]) or a duplication and its complementary deficiency (i.e., [Dp + Df]). The [T + N] heterokaryons result from alternate segregation of homologous centromeres, whereas adjacent-1 segregation generates [Dp + Df]. Self-cross of either heterokaryon produces [T + N] and [Dp + Df] progeny. Occasionally during N. tetrasperma ascus development, a pair of smaller homokaryotic ascospores replaces a heterokaryotic ascospore. Crosses with the Eight-spore mutant increase such replacement, and can generate asci with eight homokaryotic ascospores, either 4T + 4N from alternate segregation, or 4Dp + 4Df from adjacent-1 segregation. Crosses of some of the introgressed translocation strains with normal sequence N. tetrasperma produced more Dp than T or N homokaryotic progeny. We suggest this is due to an insufficiency for a presumptive ascospore maturation factor, which increases the chance that, in asci with > 4 viable ascospores, none properly mature. Since only four viable ascospores (Dp or [Dp + Df]) share the limiting factor following adjacent-1 segregation, whereas four to eight ascospores compete for it following alternate segregation, this would explain why Dp homokaryons outnumber T and N types, whereas the heterokaryons are not as affected. We believe that this novel form of transmission ratio distortion is caused by a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibility (BDMI) triggered by an N. crassa gene in the N. tetrasperma background. Heterokaryons tend not to out-cross, and crosses of Dp strains are barren, thus the BDMI impedes interspecies gene flow.","['chromosome translocation', 'introgression', 'meiotic drive', 'segregation distortion']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",India,2016 Aug 9
24350607,Determinants of regioselective hydroxylation in the fungal polysaccharide monooxygenases.,"The ubiquitous fungal polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs) (also known as GH61 proteins, LPMOs, and AA9 proteins) are structurally related but have significant variation in sequence. A heterologous expression method in Neurospora crassa was developed as a step toward connecting regioselectivity of the chemistry to PMO phylogeny. Activity assays, as well as sequence and phylogenetic analyses, showed that the majority of fungal PMOs fall into three major groups with distinctive active site surface features. PMO1s and PMO2s hydroxylate glycosidic positions C1 and C4, respectively. PMO3s hydroxylate both C1 and C4. A subgroup of PMO3s (PMO3*) hydroxylate C1.

25132551,Transcriptional interference by antisense RNA is required for circadian clock function.,"Eukaryotic circadian oscillators consist of negative feedback loops that generate endogenous rhythmicities. Natural antisense RNAs are found in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. Nevertheless, the physiological importance and mode of action of most antisense RNAs are not clear. frequency (frq) encodes a component of the Neurospora core circadian negative feedback loop, which was thought to generate sustained rhythmicity. Transcription of qrf, the long non-coding frq antisense RNA, is induced by light, and its level oscillates in antiphase to frq sense RNA. Here we show that qrf transcription is regulated by both light-dependent and light-independent mechanisms. Light-dependent qrf transcription represses frq expression and regulates clock resetting. Light-independent qrf expression, on the other hand, is required for circadian rhythmicity. frq transcription also inhibits qrf expression and drives the antiphasic rhythm of qrf transcripts. The mutual inhibition of frq and qrf transcription thus forms a double negative feedback loop that is interlocked with the core feedback loop. Genetic and mathematical modelling analyses indicate that such an arrangement is required for robust and sustained circadian rhythmicity. Moreover, our results suggest that antisense transcription inhibits sense expression by mediating chromatin modifications and premature termination of transcription. Taken together, our results establish antisense transcription as an essential feature in a circadian system and shed light on the importance and mechanism of antisense action.",?,Nature,USA,2014 Oct 30
30011361,Direct conversion of cellulose into ethanol and ethyl-beta-d-glucoside via engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of cellulose via engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a sustainable solution to valorize cellulose into fuels and chemicals. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of direct conversion of cellulose into ethanol and a biodegradable surfactant, ethyl-beta-d-glucoside, via an engineered yeast strain (i.e., strain EJ2) expressing heterologous cellodextrin transporter (CDT-1) and intracellular beta-glucosidase (GH1-1) originating from Neurospora crassa. We identified the formation of ethyl-beta-d-glucoside in SSF of cellulose by the EJ2 strain owing to transglycosylation activity of GH1-1. The EJ2 strain coproduced 0.34 +/- 0.03 g ethanol/g cellulose and 0.06 +/- 0.00 g ethyl-beta-d-glucoside/g cellulose at a rate of 0.30 +/- 0.02 g.L(-1) .h(-1) and 0.09 +/- 01 g.L(-1) .h(-1) , respectively, during the SSF of Avicel PH-101 cellulose, supplemented only with Celluclast 1.5 L. Herein, we report a possible coproduction of a value-added chemical (alkyl-glucosides) during SSF of cellulose exploiting the transglycosylation activity of GH1-1 in engineered S. cerevisiae.

28729421,The small G protein RAS2 is involved in the metabolic compensation of the circadian clock in the circadian model Neurospora crassa.,"Accumulating evidence from both experimental and clinical investigations indicates a tight interaction between metabolism and circadian timekeeping; however, knowledge of the underlying mechanism is still incomplete. Metabolic compensation allows circadian oscillators to run with a constant speed at different substrate levels and, therefore, is a substantial criterion of a robust rhythm in a changing environment. Because previous data have suggested a central role of RAS2-mediated signaling in the adaptation of yeast to different nutritional environments, we examined the involvement of RAS2 in the metabolic regulation of the clock in the circadian model organism Neurospora crassa We show that, in a ras2-deficient strain, the period is longer than in the control. Moreover, unlike in the WT, in Deltaras2, operation of the circadian clock was affected by glucose; compared with starvation conditions, the period was longer and the oscillation of expression of the frequency (frq) gene was dampened. In constant darkness, the delayed phosphorylation of the FRQ protein and the long-lasting accumulation of FRQ in the nucleus were in accordance with the longer period and the less robust rhythm in the mutant. Although glucose did not affect the subcellular distribution of FRQ in the WT, highly elevated FRQ levels were detected in the nucleus in Deltaras2 RAS2 interacted with the RAS-binding domain of the adenylate cyclase in vitro, and the cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cyclic AMP partially rescued the circadian phenotype in vivo We therefore propose that RAS2 acts via a cAMP-dependent pathway and exerts significant metabolic control on the Neurospora circadian clock.","['Neurospora', 'Ras protein', 'cAMP', 'circadian rhythm', 'entrainment', 'glucose compensation', 'small GTPase']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Hungary,2017 Sep 8
32938938,Arrangement and symmetry of the fungal E3BP-containing core of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.,"The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a multienzyme complex central to aerobic respiration, connecting glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate. Similar to the E3-binding protein (E3BP) of mammalian PDC, PX selectively recruits E3 to the fungal PDC, but its divergent sequence suggests a distinct structural mechanism. Here, we report reconstructions of PDC from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa by cryo-electron microscopy, where we find protein X (PX) interior to the PDC core as opposed to substituting E2 core subunits as in mammals. Steric occlusion limits PX binding, resulting in predominantly tetrahedral symmetry, explaining previous observations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The PX-binding site is conserved in (and specific to) fungi, and complements possible C-terminal binding motifs in PX that are absent in mammalian E3BP. Consideration of multiple symmetries thus reveals a differential structural basis for E3BP-like function in fungal PDC.",?,Nature communications,Sweden,2020 Sep 16

The canonical signaling mechanism involves two LOV-containing proteins that maintain homology to Neurospora crassa Vivid (NcVVD) and White Collar 1 (NcWC1). These proteins engage in homo- and heterodimerization events that modulate gene transcription in response to light. Here, we clone and characterize the VVD homolog in Botrytis cinerea (BcVVD). BcVVD retains divergent photocycle kinetics and is incapable of LOV mediated homodimerization, indicating modification of the classical hetero/homodimerization mechanism of photoadaptation in fungi.",?,Photochemistry and photobiology,TX,2018 Sep
28655822,Translation Initiation from Conserved Non-AUG Codons Provides Additional Layers of Regulation and Coding Capacity.,"Neurospora crassa cpc-1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN4 are homologs specifying transcription activators that drive the transcriptional response to amino acid limitation. The cpc-1 mRNA contains two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its >700-nucleotide (nt) 5' leader, and its expression is controlled at the level of translation in response to amino acid starvation. We used N. crassa cell extracts and obtained data indicating that cpc-1 uORF1 and uORF2 are functionally analogous to GCN4 uORF1 and uORF4, respectively, in controlling translation. We also found that the 5' region upstream of the main coding sequence of the cpc-1 mRNA extends for more than 700 nucleotides without any in-frame stop codon. For 100 cpc-1 homologs from Pezizomycotina and from selected Basidiomycota, 5' conserved extensions of the CPC1 reading frame are also observed. Multiple non-AUG near-cognate codons (NCCs) in the CPC1 reading frame upstream of uORF2, some deeply conserved, could potentially initiate translation. At least four NCCs initiated translation in vitroIn vivo data were consistent with initiation at NCCs to produce N-terminally extended N. crassa CPC1 isoforms. The pivotal role played by CPC1, combined with its translational regulation by uORFs and NCC utilization, underscores the emerging significance of noncanonical initiation events in controlling gene expression.IMPORTANCE There is a deepening and widening appreciation of the diverse roles of translation in controlling gene expression. A central fungal transcription factor, the best-studied example of which is Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN4, is crucial for the response to amino acid limitation. Two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the GCN4 mRNA are critical for controlling GCN4 synthesis. We observed that two uORFs in the corresponding Neurospora crassa cpc-1 mRNA appear functionally analogous to the GCN4 uORFs. We also discovered that, surprisingly, unlike GCN4, the CPC1 coding sequence extends far upstream from the presumed AUG start codon with no other in-frame AUG codons. Similar extensions were seen in homologs from many filamentous fungi. We observed that multiple non-AUG near-cognate codons (NCCs) in this extended reading frame, some conserved, initiated translation to produce longer forms of CPC1, underscoring the significance of noncanonical initiation in controlling gene expression.","['Neurospora', 'filamentous fungi', 'gene regulation', 'molecular genetics', 'translational control']",mBio,Ireland,2017 Jun 27
35638737,Transcriptional Divergence Underpinning Sexual Development in the Fungal Class Sordariomycetes.,"Gene expression divergence through evolutionary processes is thought to be important for achieving programmed development in multicellular organisms. To test this premise in filamentous fungi, we investigated transcriptional profiles of 3,942 single-copy orthologous genes (SCOGs) in five related sordariomycete species that have morphologically diverged in the formation of their flask-shaped perithecia. We compared expression of the SCOGs to inferred gene expression levels of the most recent common ancestor of the five species, ranking genes from their largest increases to smallest increases in expression during perithecial development in each of the five species. We found that a large proportion of the genes that exhibited evolved increases in gene expression were important for normal perithecial development in Fusarium graminearum. Many of these genes were previously uncharacterized, encoding hypothetical proteins without any known functional protein domains. Interestingly, the developmental stages during which aberrant knockout phenotypes appeared largely coincided with the elevated expression of the deleted genes. In addition, we identified novel genes that affected normal perithecial development in Magnaporthe oryzae and Neurospora crassa, which were functionally and transcriptionally diverged from the orthologous counterparts in F. graminearum. Furthermore, comparative analysis of developmental transcriptomes and phylostratigraphic analysis suggested that genes encoding hypothetical proteins are generally young and transcriptionally divergent between related species. This study provides tangible evidence of shifts in gene expression that led to acquisition of novel function of orthologous genes in each lineage and demonstrates that several genes with hypothetical function are crucial for shaping multicellular fruiting bodies. IMPORTANCE The fungal class Sordariomycetes includes numerous important plant and animal pathogens. It also provides model systems for studying fungal fruiting body development, as its members develop fruiting bodies with a few well-characterized tissue types on common growth media and have rich genomic resources that enable comparative and functional analyses. To understand transcriptional divergence of key developmental genes between five related sordariomycete fungi, we performed targeted knockouts of genes inferred to have evolved significant upward shifts in expression. We found that many previously uncharacterized genes play indispensable roles at different stages of fruiting body development, which have undergone transcriptional activation in specific lineages. These novel genes are predicted to be phylogenetically young and tend to be involved in lineage- or species-specific function. Transcriptional activation of genes with unknown function seems to be more frequent than ever thought, which may be crucial for rapid adaption to changing environments for successful sexual reproduction.","['Fusarium graminearum', 'gene expression divergence', 'hypothetical proteins', 'perithecia development', 'single-copy orthologs']",mBio,USA,2022 Jun 28
27225023,Construction of plasmid-free Escherichia coli for the production of arabitol-free xylitol from corncob hemicellulosic hydrolysate.,"High costs and low production efficiency are a serious constraint to bio-based xylitol production. For industrial-scale production of xylitol, a plasmid-free Escherichia coli for arabitol-free xylitol production from corncob hemicellulosic hydrolysate has been constructed. Instead of being plasmid and inducer dependent, this strain relied on multiple-copy integration of xylose reductase (XR) genes into the chromosome, where their expression was controlled by the constitutive promoter P43. In addition, to minimize the flux from L-arabinose to arabitol, two strategies including low XR total activity and high selectivity of XR has been adopted. Arabitol was significantly decreased using plasmid-free strain which had lower XR total activity and an eight point-mutations of XR with a 27-fold lower enzyme activity toward L-arabinose was achieved. The plasmid-free strain in conjunction with this mutant XR can completely eliminate arabitol formation in xylitol production. In fed-batch fermentation, this plasmid-free strain produced 143.8 g L(-1) xylitol at 1.84 g L(-1) h(-1) from corncob hemicellulosic hydrolysate. From these results, we conclude that this route by plasmid-free E. coli has potential to become a commercially viable process for xylitol production.",?,Scientific reports,China,2016 May 26
28004877,Oxygen Activation at the Active Site of a Fungal Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase.,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases have attracted vast attention owing to their abilities to disrupt glycosidic bonds via oxidation instead of hydrolysis and to enhance enzymatic digestion of recalcitrant substrates including chitin and cellulose. We have determined high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of an enzyme from Neurospora crassa in the resting state and of a copper(II) dioxo intermediate complex formed in the absence of substrate. X-ray crystal structures also revealed ""pre-bound"" molecular oxygen adjacent to the active site. An examination of protonation states enabled by neutron crystallography and density functional theory calculations identified a role for a conserved histidine in promoting oxygen activation. These results provide a new structural description of oxygen activation by substrate free lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases and provide insights that can be extended to reactivity in the enzyme-substrate complex.","['copper', 'oxidoreductases', 'oxygen activation', 'polysaccharide monooxygenases', 'protein structures']",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),USA,2017 Jan 16
28286319,Establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 in Alternaria alternata.,"The filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata is a potent producer of many secondary metabolites, some of which like alternariol or alternariol-methyl ether are toxic and/or cancerogenic. Many Alternaria species do not only cause post-harvest losses of food and feed, but are aggressive plant pathogens. Despite the great economic importance and the large number of research groups working with the fungus, the molecular toolbox is rather underdeveloped. Gene deletions often result in heterokaryotic strains and therefore, gene-function analyses are rather tedious. In addition, A. alternata lacks a sexual cycle and classical genetic approaches cannot be combined with molecular biological methods. Here, we show that CRISPR/Cas9 can be efficiently used for gene inactivation. Two genes of the melanin biosynthesis pathway, pksA and brm2, were chosen as targets. Several white mutants were obtained after several rounds of strain purification through protoplast regeneration or spore inoculation. Mutation of the genes was due to deletions from 1bp to 1.5kbp. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was also used to inactivate the orotidine-5-phosphate decarboxylase gene pyrG to create a uracil-auxotrophic strain. The strain was counter-selected with fluor-orotic acid and could be re-transformed with pyrG from Aspergillus fumigatus and pyr-4 from Neurospora crassa. In order to test the functioning of GFP, the fluorescent protein was fused to a nuclear localization signal derived from the StuA transcription factor of Aspergillus nidulans. After transformation bright nuclei were visible.","['Alternaria', 'CRISPR', 'Knock-out', 'Uracil']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Germany,2017 Apr
28799032,Biosynthesis of copper carbonate nanoparticles by ureolytic fungi.,"In this research, the ureolytic fungi Neurospora crassa, Pestalotiopsis sp. and Myrothecium gramineum were investigated for the preparation of nanoscale copper carbonate and the role of fungal extracellular protein in such mineral formation. After incubation in urea-modified media, carbonate-laden fungal supernatants were used for the precipitation of copper carbonate, with experimental results agreeing closely with those obtained using geochemical modelling (Geochemist's Workbench). Compared with commercial and chemically synthesized copper carbonate, the minerals obtained using fungal supernatants were nanoscale and showed varying morphologies. It was found that extracellular protein played an important role in determining the size and morphology of the carbonate minerals precipitated, and after mixture with CuCl(2) and resultant copper carbonate precipitation, more than 80% protein was removed from the N. crassa supernatant. Moreover, with addition of extracellular protein extracted from different fungal supernatants or standard bovine serum albumin, more than 96% of protein was removed by carbonate mineral precipitation. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the preparation of copper carbonate nanoparticles utilizing fungal ureolytic activity and show that fungal extracellular protein plays an important role in the formation and size of specific nano metal carbonates. Such a process provides opportunities for production of specific and/or novel metal carbonate nanoparticles of applied relevance, and as precursors of other useful biomineral products such as oxides.","['Biosynthesis', 'Copper carbonate', 'Extracellular protein', 'Ureolytic fungi']",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,UK,2017 Oct
25421388,Development and physiological characterization of cellobiose-consuming Yarrowia lipolytica.,"Yarrowia lipolytica is a promising production host for a wide range of molecules, but limited sugar consumption abilities prevent utilization of an abundant source of renewable feedstocks. In this study we created a Y. lipolytica strain capable of utilizing cellobiose as a sole carbon source by using endogenous promoters to express the cellodextrin transporter cdt-1 and intracellular beta-glucosidase gh1-1 from Neurospora crassa. The engineered strain was also capable of simultaneous co-consumption of glucose and cellobiose. Although cellobiose was consumed slower than glucose when engineered strains were cultured with excess nitrogen, culturing with limited nitrogen led to cellobiose consumption rates comparable to those of glucose. Under limited nitrogen conditions, the engineered strain produced citric acid as a major product and we observed greater citric acid yields from cellobiose (0.37 g/g) than glucose (0.28 g/g). Culturing with a sole carbon source of either glucose or cellobiose induced additional differences on cell physiology and metabolism and a link is suggested to evasion of glucose-sensing mechanisms through intracellular creation and consumption of glucose. We ultimately applied this cellobiose-utilization system to produce citric acid from bioconversion of crystalline cellulose through simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF).","['biofuels', 'biotransformation', 'cellodextrin', 'citric acid', 'lignocellulose', 'lipid']",Biotechnology and bioengineering,61801,2015 May
29463750,Light-activated protein interaction with high spatial subcellular confinement.,"Methods to acutely manipulate protein interactions at the subcellular level are powerful tools in cell biology. Several blue-light-dependent optical dimerization tools have been developed. In these systems one protein component of the dimer (the bait) is directed to a specific subcellular location, while the other component (the prey) is fused to the protein of interest. Upon illumination, binding of the prey to the bait results in its subcellular redistribution. Here, we compared and quantified the extent of light-dependent dimer occurrence in small, subcellular volumes controlled by three such tools: Cry2/CIB1, iLID, and Magnets. We show that both the location of the photoreceptor protein(s) in the dimer pair and its (their) switch-off kinetics determine the subcellular volume where dimer formation occurs and the amount of protein recruited in the illuminated volume. Efficient spatial confinement of dimer to the area of illumination is achieved when the photosensitive component of the dimerization pair is tethered to the membrane of intracellular compartments and when on and off kinetics are extremely fast, as achieved with iLID or Magnets. Magnets and the iLID variants with the fastest switch-off kinetics induce and maintain protein dimerization in the smallest volume, although this comes at the expense of the total amount of dimer. These findings highlight the distinct features of different optical dimerization systems and will be useful guides in the choice of tools for specific applications.","['Cry2/CIB1', 'LOV domain', 'optical dimerizer', 'optogenetics', 'protein-protein interaction']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CT 06510,2018 Mar 6

To investigate the function of ergothioneine, we crossed the wild type Neurospora crassa (Egt(+)) and an ergothioneine non-producer (Egt(-), Deltaegt-1, a knockout in NCU04343.5) and used the Egt(+) and Egt(-) progeny strains for phenotypic analyses. Compared to the Egt(+) strains, Egt(-) strains had a 59% reduction in the number of conidia produced on Vogel's agar. After storage of Egt(+) and Egt(-) conidia at 97% and 52% relative humidity (RH) for a time course to either 17 or 98 days, respectively, Egt(-) strains had a 23% and a 18% reduction in life expectancy at 97% and 52% RH, respectively, compared to the Egt(+) strains. Based on a Cu(II) reduction assay with the chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid disodium salt, ergothioneine accounts for 38% and 33% of water-soluble antioxidant capacity in N. crassa conidia from seven and 20 day-old cultures, respectively. In contrast, ergothioneine did not account for significant (alpha=0.05) anti-oxidant capacity in mycelia, which have lower concentrations of ergothioneine than conidia. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that ergothioneine has an antioxidant function in vivo. In contrast, experiments on the spontaneous mutation rate in Egt(+) and Egt(-) strains and on the effects of 254 nm UV light on mutation rate and conidial viability do not support the hypothesis that ergothioneine protects DNA in vivo.","['Antioxidant', 'Conidia', 'Conidiogenesis', 'Ergothioneine', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Reactive oxygen species']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,United States,2014 Dec
26578794,Genome-wide redistribution of H3K27me3 is linked to genotoxic stress and defective growth.,"H3K9 methylation directs heterochromatin formation by recruiting multiple heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-containing complexes that deacetylate histones and methylate cytosine bases in DNA. In Neurospora crassa, a single H3K9 methyltransferase complex, called the DIM-5,-7,-9, CUL4, DDB1 Complex (DCDC), is required for normal growth and development. DCDC-deficient mutants are hypersensitive to the genotoxic agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), but the molecular basis of genotoxic stress is unclear. We found that both the MMS sensitivity and growth phenotypes of DCDC-deficient strains are suppressed by mutation of embryonic ectoderm development or Su-(var)3-9; E(z); Trithorax (set)-7, encoding components of the H3K27 methyltransferase Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2). Trimethylated histone H3K27 (H3K27me3) undergoes genome-wide redistribution to constitutive heterochromatin in DCDC- or HP1-deficient mutants, and introduction of an H3K27 missense mutation is sufficient to rescue phenotypes of DCDC-deficient strains. Accumulation of H3K27me3 in heterochromatin does not compensate for silencing; rather, strains deficient for both DCDC and PRC2 exhibit synthetic sensitivity to the topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin and accumulate gammaH2A at heterochromatin. Together, these data suggest that PRC2 modulates the response to genotoxic stress.","['H3K27me3', 'H3K9me3', 'Polycomb', 'genotoxic stress', 'heterochromatin']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,GA 30602,2015 Nov 17
33051373,Nonoptimal Codon Usage Is Critical for Protein Structure and Function of the Master General Amino Acid Control Regulator CPC-1.,"Under amino acid starvation conditions, eukaryotic organisms activate a general amino acid control response. In Neurospora crassa, Cross Pathway Control Protein 1 (CPC-1), the ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae bZIP transcription factor GCN4, functions as the master regulator of the general amino acid control response. Codon usage biases are a universal feature of eukaryotic genomes and are critical for regulation of gene expression. Although codon usage has also been implicated in the regulation of protein structure and function, genetic evidence supporting this conclusion is very limited. Here, we show that Neurospora cpc-1 has a nonoptimal NNU-rich codon usage profile that contrasts with the strong NNC codon preference in the genome. Although substitution of the cpc-1 NNU codons with synonymous NNC codons elevated CPC-1 expression in Neurospora, it altered the CPC-1 degradation rate and abolished its amino acid starvation-induced protein stabilization. The codon-manipulated CPC-1 protein also exhibited different sensitivity to limited protease digestion. Furthermore, CPC-1 functions in rescuing the cell growth of the cpc-1 deletion mutant and activation of the expression of its target genes were impaired by the synonymous codon changes. Together, these results reveal the critical role of codon usage in regulation of CPC-1 expression and function and establish a genetic example of the importance of codon usage in protein folding.IMPORTANCE The general amino acid control response is critical for adaptation of organisms to amino acid starvation conditions. The preference to use certain synonymous codons is a universal feature of all genomes. Synonymous codon changes were previously thought to be silent mutations. In this study, we showed that the Neurospora cpc-1 gene has an unusual codon usage profile compared to other genes in the genome. We found that codon optimization of the cpc-1 gene without changing its amino acid sequence resulted in elevated CPC-1 expression, an altered protein degradation rate, and impaired protein functions due to changes in protein structure. Together, these results reveal the critical role of synonymous codon usage in regulation of CPC-1 expression and function and establish a genetic example of the importance of codon usage in protein structure.","['CPC-1', 'GCN4', 'Neurospora', 'codon usage', 'cotranslational protein folding', 'cross-pathway control', 'translation elongation']",mBio,USA,2020 Oct 13
24569026,Predicting essential genes for identifying potential drug targets in Aspergillus fumigatus.,"BACKGROUND: Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is a ubiquitous and opportunistic pathogen capable of causing acute, invasive pulmonary disease in susceptible hosts. Despite current therapeutic options, mortality associated with invasive Af infections remains unacceptably high, increasing 357% since 1980. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including more efficacious drugs acting on new targets. Thus, as noted in a recent review, ""the identification of essential genes in fungi represents a crucial step in the development of new antifungal drugs"". Expanding the target space by rapidly identifying new essential genes has thus been described as ""the most important task of genomics-based target validation"". RESULTS: In previous research, we were the first to show that essential gene annotation can be reliably transferred between distantly related four Prokaryotic species. In this study, we extend our machine learning approach to the much more complex Eukaryotic fungal species. A compendium of essential genes is predicted in Af by transferring known essential gene annotations from another filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. This approach predicts essential genes by integrating diverse types of intrinsic and context-dependent genomic features encoded in microbial genomes. The predicted essential datasets contained 1674 genes. We validated our results by comparing our predictions with known essential genes in Af, comparing our predictions with those predicted by homology mapping, and conducting conditional expressed alleles. We applied several layers of filters and selected a set of potential drug targets from the predicted essential genes. Finally, we have conducted wet lab knockout experiments to verify our predictions, which further validates the accuracy and wide applicability of the machine learning approach. CONCLUSIONS: The approach presented here significantly extended our ability to predict essential genes beyond orthologs and made it possible to predict an inventory of essential genes in Eukaryotic fungal species, amongst which a preferred subset of suitable drug targets may be selected. By selecting the best new targets, we believe that resultant drugs would exhibit an unparalleled clinical impact against a naive pathogen population. Additional benefits that a compendium of essential genes can provide are important information on cell function and evolutionary biology. Furthermore, mapping essential genes to pathways may also reveal critical check points in the pathogen's metabolism. Finally, this approach is highly reproducible and portable, and can be easily applied to predict essential genes in many more pathogenic microbes, especially those unculturable.","['Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Drug targets', 'Essential genes', 'Fungi', 'Integrative', 'Machine learning']",Computational biology and chemistry,PR China,2014 Jun
32142473,The structure of the TOM core complex in the mitochondrial outer membrane.,"In the past three decades, significant advances have been made in providing the biochemical background of TOM (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane)-mediated protein translocation into mitochondria. In the light of recent cryoelectron microscopy-derived structures of TOM isolated from Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the interpretation of biochemical and biophysical studies of TOM-mediated protein transport into mitochondria now rests on a solid basis. In this review, we compare the subnanometer structure of N. crassa TOM core complex with that of yeast. Both structures reveal remarkably well-conserved symmetrical dimers of 10 membrane protein subunits. The structural data also validate predictions of weakly stable regions in the transmembrane beta-barrel domains of the protein-conducting subunit Tom40, which signal the existence of beta-strands located in interfaces of protein-protein interactions.","['TOM complex', 'cryo-EM', 'mitochondria', 'protein translocation', 'protein-conducting channel', 'beta-barrel energetics']",Biological chemistry,Germany,2020 May 26
24523289,The Neurospora crassa exocyst complex tethers Spitzenkorper vesicles to the apical plasma membrane during polarized growth.,"Fungal hyphae are among the most highly polarized cells. Hyphal polarized growth is supported by tip-directed transport of secretory vesicles, which accumulate temporarily in a stratified manner in an apical vesicle cluster, the Spitzenkorper. The exocyst complex is required for tethering of secretory vesicles to the apical plasma membrane. We determined that the presence of an octameric exocyst complex is required for the formation of a functional Spitzenkorper and maintenance of regular hyphal growth in Neurospora crassa. Two distinct localization patterns of exocyst subunits at the hyphal tip suggest the dynamic formation of two assemblies. The EXO-70/EXO-84 subunits are found at the peripheral part of the Spitzenkorper, which partially coincides with the outer macrovesicular layer, whereas exocyst components SEC-5, -6, -8, and -15 form a delimited crescent at the apical plasma membrane. Localization of SEC-6 and EXO-70 to the plasma membrane and the Spitzenkorper, respectively, depends on actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The apical region of exocyst-mediated vesicle fusion, elucidated by the plasma membrane-associated exocyst subunits, indicates the presence of an exocytotic gradient with a tip-high maximum that dissipates gradually toward the subapex, confirming the earlier predictions of the vesicle supply center model for hyphal morphogenesis.",?,Molecular biology of the cell,CA 92093,2014 Apr
25598218,Prevalent and distinct spliceosomal 3'-end processing mechanisms for fungal telomerase RNA.,"Telomerase RNA (TER) is an essential component of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex. The mechanism for TER 3'-end processing is highly divergent among different organisms. Here we report a unique spliceosome-mediated TER 3'-end cleavage mechanism in Neurospora crassa that is distinct from that found specifically in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. While the S. pombe TER intron contains the canonical 5'-splice site GUAUGU, the N. crassa TER intron contains a non-canonical 5'-splice site AUAAGU that alone prevents the second step of splicing and promotes spliceosomal cleavage. The unique N. crassa TER 5'-splice site sequence is evolutionarily conserved in TERs from Pezizomycotina and early branching Taphrinomycotina species. This suggests that the widespread and basal N. crassa-type spliceosomal cleavage mechanism is more ancestral than the S. pombe-type. The discovery of a prevalent, yet distinct, spliceosomal cleavage mechanism throughout diverse fungal clades furthers our understanding of TER evolution and non-coding RNA processing.",?,Nature communications,USA,2015 Jan 19
30557615,Engineering two species of yeast as cell factories for 2'-fucosyllactose.,"Oligosaccharides present in human breast milk have been linked to beneficial effects on infant health. Inclusion of these human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in infant formula can recapitulate these health benefits. As a result, there is substantial commercial interest in a cost-effective source of HMOs as infant formula ingredients. Here we demonstrate that the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica both can be engineered to produce 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL), which is the most abundant oligosaccharide in human breast milk, at high titer and productivity. Both yeast species were modified to enable uptake of lactose and synthesis of GDP-fucose - the two precursors of 2'FL - by installing a lactose transporter and enzymes that convert GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. Production of 2'FL was then enabled by expression of alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferases from various organisms. By screening candidate transporters from a variety of sources, we identified transporters capable of exporting 2'FL from yeast, which is a key consideration for any biocatalyst for 2'FL production. In particular, we identified CDT2 from Neurospora crassa as a promising target for further engineering to improve 2'FL efflux. Finally, we demonstrated production of 2'FL in fermenters at rates and titers that indicate the potential of engineered S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica strains for commercial 2'FL production.",?,Metabolic engineering,USA,2019 Mar
28886200,Screening of transporters to improve xylodextrin utilization in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"The economic production of cellulosic biofuel requires efficient and full utilization of all abundant carbohydrates naturally released from plant biomass by enzyme cocktails. Recently, we reconstituted the Neurospora crassa xylodextrin transport and consumption system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enabling growth of yeast on xylodextrins aerobically. However, the consumption rate of xylodextrin requires improvement for industrial applications, including consumption in anaerobic conditions. As a first step in this improvement, we report analysis of orthologues of the N. crassa transporters CDT-1 and CDT-2. Transporter ST16 from Trichoderma virens enables faster aerobic growth of S. cerevisiae on xylodextrins compared to CDT-2. ST16 is a xylodextrin-specific transporter, and the xylobiose transport activity of ST16 is not inhibited by cellobiose. Other transporters identified in the screen also enable growth on xylodextrins including xylotriose. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple transporters might prove useful to improve xylodextrin utilization in S. cerevisiae. Efforts to use directed evolution to improve ST16 from a chromosomally-integrated copy were not successful, due to background growth of yeast on other carbon sources present in the selection medium. Future experiments will require increasing the baseline growth rate of the yeast population on xylodextrins, to ensure that the selective pressure exerted on xylodextrin transport can lead to isolation of improved xylodextrin transporters.",?,PloS one,China,2017
25423300,Biomineralization of metal carbonates by Neurospora crassa.,"In this research, the urease-positive fungus Neurospora crassa was investigated for the biomineralization of calcium carbonate and its potential application in metal biorecovery and/or bioremediation. After 12 d incubation at 25  degrees C in urea and calcium-containing medium, extensive biomineralization of fungal filaments was observed. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of crystalline precipitates on the hyphae of N. crassa showed that the main elements present in the crystals were Ca, C, and O. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the precipitates showed they were composed solely of calcite (CaCO3) and over 90% Ca could be removed from the media by the fungal biomass and associated calcite precipitation. To further investigate biologically induced metal carbonate biomineralization, CdCl2 was contacted with supernatants of N. crassa obtained after growth in urea-containing medium. XRD showed that the Cd(2+) was precipitated as pure otavite (CdCO3) with a particle size range of 55 to 870 nm, and approximately 1.5% having nanoscale dimensions. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the precipitation of metal carbonates such as calcite and otavite based on biologically induced mineralization, and suggest that urease-positive fungi may play a potential role in the synthesis of novel biominerals and in metal bioremediation or biorecovery.",?,Environmental science & technology,United Kingdom,2014 Dec 16
33551431,A partial photoreactivation defect phenotype is not due to unrepaired ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimers in ultraviolet-sensitive mutants of Neurospora crassa.,"Photoreactivation is a mechanism in which photolyase directly repairs either cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) or (6-4) photoproducts [(6-4) PPs] caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, some UV-sensitive mutants such as mus-44 have been reported to exhibit a partial photoreactivation defect (PPD) phenotype, but its mechanism has not been elucidated for a long time. In this study, the N. crassa CPD photolyase PHR was overexpressed in the Deltamus-44 strain, but photoreactivation ability was not increased. Furthermore, Escherichia coli CPD photolyase or Arabidopsis thaliana (6-4) PP photolyase was also introduced into Deltamus-44; however, the PPD phenotype was not complemented. These results suggested that the PPD phenotype in N. crassa is not caused by residual unrepaired pyrimidine dimers, which are the main type of DNA damage caused by UV irradiation. Finally, we revealed that Deltamus-44, but not the Deltamus-43 strain, which does not show the PPD phenotype, displayed higher sensitivity with increasing dose rate of UV. Moreover, Deltamus-44 was also sensitive to an interstrand crosslinking agent. This indicates that the high dose of UV in our experimental condition induces DNA damage other than pyrimidine dimers, and that such damage is a likely cause of the PPD phenotype.","['DNA repair', 'NER', 'Neurospora crassa', 'mus-43', 'mus-44', 'photoreactivation']",Genes & genetic systems,Saitama University,2021 Mar 23
24173579,"RNAi function, diversity, and loss in the fungal kingdom.","RNAi is conserved and has been studied in a broad cross-section of the fungal kingdom, including Neurospora crassa, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Mucor circinelloides. And yet well known species, including the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the plant pathogen Ustilago maydis, have lost RNAi, providing insights and opportunities to illuminate benefits conferred both by the presence of RNAi and its loss. Some of the earliest studies of RNAi were conducted in Neurospora, contemporaneously with the elucidation of RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans. RNAi is a key epigenetic mechanism for maintaining genomic stability and integrity, as well as to defend against viruses, and given its ubiquity was likely present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. In this review, we describe the diversity of RNAi mechanisms found in the fungi, highlighting recent work in Neurospora, S. pombe, and Cryptococcus.

24828577,"Genetic and metabolomic dissection of the ergothioneine and selenoneine biosynthetic pathway in the fission yeast, S. pombe, and construction of an overproduction system.","Ergothioneine is a small, sulfur-containing metabolite (229 Da) synthesized by various species of bacteria and fungi, which can accumulate to millimolar levels in tissues or cells (e.g. erythrocytes) of higher eukaryotes. It is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement due to its proposed protective and antioxidative functions. In this study we report the genes forming the two-step ergothioneine biosynthetic pathway in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We identified the first gene, egt1+ (SPBC1604.01), by sequence homology to previously published genes from Neurospora crassa and Mycobacterium smegmatis. We showed, using metabolomic analysis, that the Deltaegt1 deletion mutant completely lacked ergothioneine and its precursors (trimethyl histidine/hercynine and hercynylcysteine sulfoxide). Since the second step of ergothioneine biosynthesis has not been characterized in eukaryotes, we examined four putative homologs (Nfs1/SPBC21D10.11c, SPAC11D3.10, SPCC777.03c, and SPBC660.12c) of the corresponding mycobacterial enzyme EgtE. Among deletion mutants of these genes, only one (DeltaSPBC660.12c, designated Deltaegt2) showed a substantial decrease in ergothioneine, accompanied by accumulation of its immediate precursor, hercynylcysteine sulfoxide. Ergothioneine-deficient strains exhibited no phenotypic defects during vegetative growth or quiescence. To effectively study the role of ergothioneine, we constructed an egt1+ overexpression system by replacing its native promoter with the nmt1+ promoter, which is inducible in the absence of thiamine. We employed three versions of the nmt1 promoter with increasing strength of expression and confirmed corresponding accumulations of ergothioneine. We quantified the intracellular concentration of ergothioneine in S. pombe (0.3, 157.4, 41.6, and up to 1606.3 microM in vegetative, nitrogen-starved, glucose-starved, and egt1+-overexpressing cells, respectively) and described its gradual accumulation under long-term quiescence. Finally, we demonstrated that the ergothioneine pathway can also synthesize selenoneine, a selenium-containing derivative of ergothioneine, when the culture medium is supplemented with selenium. We further found that selenoneine biosynthesis involves a novel intermediate compound, hercynylselenocysteine.",?,PloS one,Japan,2014

Unlike gene expression mechanisms, it was found that enzymatic activity mechanisms are similar for all the studied models.

30208021,Transcription factor CBF-1 is critical for circadian gene expression by modulating WHITE COLLAR complex recruitment to the frq locus.,"Transcription of the Neurospora crassa circadian clock gene frequency (frq) is an essential process in the negative feedback loop that controls circadian rhythms. WHITE COLLAR 1 (WC-1) and WHITE COLLAR 2 (WC-2) forms the WC complex (WCC) that is the main activator of frq transcription by binding to its promoter. Here, we show that Centromere Binding Factor 1 (CBF-1) is a critical component of the N. crassa circadian clock by regulating frq transcription. Deletion of cbf-1 resulted in long period and low amplitude rhythms, whereas overexpression of CBF-1 abolished the circadian rhythms. Loss of CBF-1 resulted in WC-independent FRQ expression and suppression of WCC activity. As WCC, CBF-1 also binds to the C-box at the frq promoter. Overexpression of CBF-1 impaired WCC binding to the C-box to suppress frq transcription. Together, our results suggest that the proper level of CBF-1 is critical for circadian clock function by suppressing WC-independent FRQ expression and by regulating WCC binding to the frq promoter.",?,PLoS genetics,China,2018 Sep
25517356,Hydrophobic handoff for direct delivery of peroxisome tail-anchored proteins.,"Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are inserted into membranes post-translationally through a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). The PEX19 protein binds peroxisome TA proteins in the cytoplasm and delivers them to the membrane through the PEX3 receptor protein. An amphipathic segment in PEX19 promotes docking on PEX3. However, how this leads to substrate insertion is unknown. Here we reconstitute peroxisome TA protein biogenesis into two sequential steps of substrate TMD engagement and membrane insertion. We identify a series of previously uncharacterized amphipathic segments in PEX19 and identify one whose hydrophobicity is required for membrane insertion, but not TMD chaperone activity or PEX3 binding. A membrane-proximal hydrophobic surface of PEX3 promotes an unconventional form of membrane intercalation, and is also required for TMD insertion. Together, these data support a mechanism in which hydrophobic moieties in the TMD chaperone and its membrane-associated receptor act in a concerted manner to prompt TMD release and membrane insertion.",?,Nature communications,Singapore,2014 Dec 17
27708165,Accumulation of specific sterol precursors targets a MAP kinase cascade mediating cell-cell recognition and fusion.,"Sterols are vital components of eukaryotic cell membranes. Defects in sterol biosynthesis, which result in the accumulation of precursor molecules, are commonly associated with cellular disorders and disease. However, the effects of these sterol precursors on the metabolism, signaling, and behavior of cells are only poorly understood. In this study, we show that the accumulation of only ergosterol precursors with a conjugated double bond in their aliphatic side chain specifically disrupts cell-cell communication and fusion in the fungus Neurospora crassa Genetically identical germinating spores of this fungus undergo cell-cell fusion, thereby forming a highly interconnected supracellular network during colony initiation. Before fusion, the cells use an unusual signaling mechanism that involves the coordinated and alternating switching between signal sending and receiving states of the two fusion partners. Accumulation of only ergosterol precursors with a conjugated double bond in their aliphatic side chain disrupts this coordinated cell-cell communication and suppresses cell fusion. These specific sterol precursors target a single ERK-like mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAK-1)-signaling cascade, whereas a second MAP kinase pathway (MAK-2), which is also involved in cell fusion, is unaffected. These observations indicate that a minor specific change in sterol structure can exert a strong detrimental effect on a key signaling pathway of the cell, resulting in the absence of cell fusion.","['MAP kinase signaling', 'Neurospora crassa', 'cell fusion', 'ergosterol', 'sterol biosynthesis']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Germany,2016 Oct 18
29853094,Synergistic and long-lasting antibacterial effect of antibiotic-loaded TiCaPCON-Ag films against pathogenic bacteria and fungi.,"Implant-related bacterial infections remain a serious problem that is not solved yet. Herein we combined several antibacterial agents to achieve synergistic effects and broader protection of widely used metallic implants. Titanium samples with microcontainers for drug, produced by selective laser sintering, were coated with Ag-doped biocompatible and bioactive TiCaPCON film and loaded with an antibiotic (gentamicin or a mixture of gentamicin and amphotericin B). Bactericide release tests demonstrated that the release rate of one bactericide agent (Ag(+) ions or gentamicin) depended on the presence of the other antibacterial component. The antibacterial activity of the biocide-doped samples was evaluated against clinically isolated Escherichia coli O78 (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria, and Neurospora crassa wt-987 (N. crassa) spores. It was found that samples loaded with low gentamicin concentration (0.2 and 0.02â€¯mg/cm(2)), i.e. 10 and 100 times less than the standard gentamicin concentration (2â€¯mg/cm(2)), demonstrated a superb antibacterial activity against E. coli bacteria. We showed that a crosslinking reaction between gentamicin and TiCaPCON film proceeded either through the formation of amide bonds or via the electrostatic interaction between amine groups of gentamicin and COOH groups of TiCaPCON and led to the formation of relatively stable drug/film conjugates that prevented a rapid dissolution of gentamicin and ensured its long-term (for 72â€¯h) antibacterial protection. Leaching of silver ions provided an effective antibacterial protection after the depletion of the drug reservoirs. The obtained results clearly show a synergistic antibacterial action of Ag(+) ions and gentamicin against S. aureus bacteria. In addition, in the presence of Ag(+) ions, the antifungal activity of samples loaded with a mixture of gentamicin and amphotericin B against N. crassa fungus was observed to increase. Thus, it is demonstrated that silver can be successfully coupled with different types of antibiotics to provide innovative hybrid metal-ceramic bioconstructions that are able to deliver precise doses of bactericide agents within a certain period of time and are equally effective against Gram-negative E. coli bacteria, Gram-positive S. aureus, and N. crassa fungus.","['Ag-doped TiCaPCON films', 'Antibacterial activity', 'Antibiotic-loaded surface', 'Bactericide release', 'Fungi', 'Pathogenic bacteria']","Materials science & engineering.

24250809,Human-like eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 from Neurospora crassa.,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a key regulator of translation initiation, but its in vivo assembly and molecular functions remain unclear. Here we show that eIF3 from Neurospora crassa is structurally and compositionally similar to human eIF3. N. crassa eIF3 forms a stable 12-subunit complex linked genetically and biochemically to the 13(th) subunit, eIF3j, which in humans modulates mRNA start codon selection. Based on N. crassa genetic analysis, most subunits in eIF3 are essential. Subunits that can be deleted (e, h, k and l) map to the right side of the eIF3 complex, suggesting that they may coordinately regulate eIF3 function. Consistent with this model, subunits eIF3k and eIF3l are incorporated into the eIF3 complex as a pair, and their insertion depends on the presence of subunit eIF3h, a key regulator of vertebrate development. Comparisons to other eIF3 complexes suggest that eIF3 assembles around an eIF3a and eIF3c dimer, which may explain the coordinated regulation of human eIF3 levels. Taken together, these results show that Neurospora crassa eIF3 provides a tractable system for probing the structure and function of human-like eIF3 in the context of living cells.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2013

To the best of our knowledge, the use of bioactive metabolites derived from endophytic fungi, particularly against multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens inhabiting burn wounds, has been emphasized for the first time. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of purified benzoic acid (BA) derived from Neurospora crassa, an endophytic fungus isolated from Lycium shawii, as a promising and alternative safe antimicrobial candidate in wound healing. As a result, benzoic acid, a safe and nontoxic compound, may be a promising candidate for combating clinical MDR pathogens of burn wound infections. In this study, Neurospora crassa strain SSN01 (MW856826) was successfully identified for the first time as a new BA-producing endophytic fungus isolated from Lycium shawii. The concentration of BA in the ethyl acetate extract reached 244 mg/mL. Purified BA had a detrimental effect on the MDR strains tested, and the MDR Staphylococcus aureus strain SA-17 was clearly more susceptible to BA as compared to the other tested MDR bacterial and fungal strains. Toxicological studies on experimental animals were conducted to evaluate the toxicity of BA and a suitable dose regimen for future human use. Oral administration of BA at the highest concentration of 300 microg/kg body weight resulted in nontoxic signs and no mortality. In vivo histopathological examination revealed that BA, as a nontoxic and safe compound, could be a promising candidate for wound healing, combating MDR pathogens of burn wound infections.","['Antimicrobial activity', 'Benzoic acid', 'Endophytes', 'Lycium shawii', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Wound healing']",Microbiological research,Egypt,2022 Sep
32020195,Quantitative global studies reveal differential translational control by start codon context across the fungal kingdom.,"Eukaryotic protein synthesis generally initiates at a start codon defined by an AUG and its surrounding Kozak sequence context, but the quantitative importance of this context in different species is unclear. We tested this concept in two pathogenic Cryptococcus yeast species by genome-wide mapping of translation and of mRNA 5' and 3' ends. We observed thousands of AUG-initiated upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that are a major contributor to translation repression. uORF use depends on the Kozak sequence context of its start codon, and uORFs with strong contexts promote nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transcript leaders in Cryptococcus and other fungi are substantially longer and more AUG-dense than in Saccharomyces. Numerous Cryptococcus mRNAs encode predicted dual-localized proteins, including many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, in which a leaky AUG start codon is followed by a strong Kozak context in-frame AUG, separated by mitochondrial-targeting sequence. Analysis of other fungal species shows that such dual-localization is also predicted to be common in the ascomycete mould, Neurospora crassa. Kozak-controlled regulation is correlated with insertions in translational initiation factors in fidelity-determining regions that contact the initiator tRNA. Thus, start codon context is a signal that quantitatively programs both the expression and the structures of proteins in diverse fungi.",?,Nucleic acids research,UK,2020 Mar 18
25292207,Role of a remote leucine residue in the catalytic function of polyol dehydrogenase.,"Studies on the protein-metal binding sites have mainly focused on the residues immediately surrounding the reacting substrate, cofactors, and metal ions. The contribution of residues in remote layers to the highly optimized microenvironments of catalytic active sites is not well understood. To improve our understanding, the present study examined the role of remote residues on the structure and function of zinc-dependent polyol dehydrogenases. We used an integrated computational and biochemical approach to determine the role of L136 in the third shell of the l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (LAD) from Neurospora crassa. Substitution of L136 with charged (Asp, Lys, or His) and bulky (Trp) side chain amino acids abolished enzyme activity. Whereas the L136A mutant exhibited a 95% decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), the L136C mutant exhibited a 39% decrease in kcat/Km. Additionally, molecular docking and dynamic simulations on the mutant (L136A, L136C, L136H, and L136P) complexes showed the loss of crucial H-bonds between G77 and the corresponding mutated residue. It is evident from theoretical and biochemical studies that the L136 is part of the extensive hydrogen bonding network coupled to the reaction catalyzed at the active site. We propose that L136, critically positioned behind the active site residues H78 and E79 in the third shell of LAD, plays a crucial role in modulating catalysis or substrate binding by stabilizing the GHE motif in the LAD active site.",?,Molecular bioSystems,Republic of Korea. jkrhee@konkuk.ac.kr,2014 Dec
33121519,The selectivity filter of the mitochondrial protein import machinery.,"BACKGROUND: The uptake of newly synthesized nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins from the cytosol is mediated by a complex of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins comprising a central pore-forming component and associated receptor proteins. Distinct fractions of proteins initially bind to the receptor proteins and are subsequently transferred to the pore-forming component for import. The aim of this study was the identification of the decisive elements of this machinery that determine the specific selection of the proteins that should be imported. RESULTS: We identified the essential internal targeting signal of the members of the mitochondrial metabolite carrier proteins, the largest protein family of the mitochondria, and we investigated the specific recognition of this signal by the protein import machinery at the mitochondrial outer surface. We found that the outer membrane import receptors facilitated the uptake of these proteins, and we identified the corresponding binding site, marked by cysteine C141 in the receptor protein Tom70. However, in tests both in vivo and in vitro, the import receptors were neither necessary nor sufficient for specific recognition of the targeting signals. Although these signals are unrelated to the amino-terminal presequences that mediate the targeting of other mitochondrial preproteins, they were found to resemble presequences in their strict dependence on a content of positively charged residues as a prerequisite of interactions with the import pore. CONCLUSIONS: The general import pore of the mitochondrial outer membrane appears to represent not only the central channel of protein translocation but also to form the decisive general selectivity filter in the uptake of the newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins.","['Chaperones', 'Ion channel', 'Mitochondria', 'Protein targeting', 'Selectivity filter', 'TOM complex', 'Tom40', 'Tom70']",BMC biology,Germany,2020 Oct 29
31698975,The fungal mitochondrial Nad5 pan-genic intron landscape.,"An intron landscape was prepared for the fungal mitochondrial nad5 gene. A hundred and eighty-eight fungal species were examined and a total of 265 introns were noted to be located in 29 intron insertion sites within the examined nad5 genes. Two hundred and sixty-three introns could be classified as group I types and two group II introns were noted. One additional group II intron module was identified nested within a composite group I intron. Based on features related to RNA secondary structures, introns can be classified into different subtypes and it was observed that intron insertion-sites are biased towards phase 0 and they appear to be specific to an intron type. Intron landscapes could be used as a guide map to predict the location of fungal mtDNA mobile introns, which are composite elements that include a ribozyme component and in some instances open reading frames encoding homing endonucleases or reverse transcriptases and all of these have applications in biotechnology.","['Core creep', 'Group I intron', 'Intron insertion-sites', 'Intron phasing']","Mitochondrial DNA.

We present experimental evidence of inaccessibility within heterochromatin regions in Neurospora, and we examine features of both accessible and inaccessible chromatin, including the presence of histone modifications, types of transcription, transcription factor binding, and relative nucleosome turnover rates. Chromatin accessibility is not strictly correlated with expression level. Accessible chromatin regions in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora are characterized the presence of H3K27 acetylation and commonly associated with pervasive non-coding transcription. Conversely, methylation of H3 lysine-36 catalyzed by ASH1 is correlated with inaccessible chromatin within promoter regions. CONCLUSIONS: In N. crassa, H3K27 acetylation is the most predictive histone modification for open chromatin. Conversely, our data show that H3K36 methylation is a key marker of inaccessible chromatin in gene-rich regions of the genome. Our data are consistent with an expanded role for H3K36 methylation in intergenic regions of filamentous fungi compared to the model yeasts, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, which lack homologs of the ASH1 methyltransferase.","['ATAC-seq', 'Chromatin accessibility', 'Fungi', 'H3K36me3']",BMC genomics,USA,2021 Jun 19
36151124,Identification and expression of functionally conserved circadian clock genes in lichen-forming fungi.,"Lichen-forming fungi establish stable symbioses with green algae or cyanobacteria. Many species have broad distributions, both in geographic and ecological space, making them ideal subjects to study organism-environment interactions. However, little is known about the specific mechanisms that contribute to environmental adaptation in lichen-forming fungi. The circadian clock provides a well-described mechanism that contributes to regional adaptation across a variety of species, including fungi. Here, we identify the putative circadian clock components in phylogenetically divergent lichen-forming fungi. The core circadian genes (frq, wc-1, wc-2, frh) are present across the Fungi, including 31 lichen-forming species, and their evolutionary trajectories mirror overall fungal evolution. Comparative analyses of the clock genes indicate conserved domain architecture among lichen- and non-lichen-forming taxa. We used RT-qPCR to examine the core circadian loop of two unrelated lichen-forming fungi, Umbilicaria pustulata (Lecanoromycetes) and Dermatocarpon miniatum (Eurotiomycetes), to determine that the putative frq gene is activated in a light-dependent manner similar to the model fungus Neurospora crassa. Together, these results demonstrate that lichen-forming fungi retain functional light-responsive mechanisms, including a functioning circadian clock. Our findings provide a stepping stone into investigating the circadian clock in the lichen symbiosis, e.g. its role in adaptation, and in synchronizing the symbiotic interaction.",?,Scientific reports,Germany. henrique.valim@senckenberg.de,2022 Sep 23
31916434,Determination of the Distance Between the Cytochrome and Dehydrogenase Domains of Immobilized Cellobiose Dehydrogenase by Using Surface Plasmon Resonance with a Center of Mass Based Model.,"Changes in the tertiary conformation of adsorbed biomolecules can induce detectable shifts (Deltatheta(r)) in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) angle. Here it is shown how to calculate the corresponding shifts in the adsorbate's center of mass (Deltaz(avg)) along the sensing surface normal from the measured Deltatheta(r). The novel developed model was used for determining the mean distance between the cytochrome (CYT) and flavodehydrogenase (DH) domains of the enzyme cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) isolated from the fungi Neurospora crassa, Corynascus thermophilus, and Myriococcum thermophilum as a function of pH, [Ca(2+)], and substrate concentration. SPR confirmed the results from earlier electrochemical and SAXS studies stating that the closed conformation, where the two domains are in close vicinity, is stabilized by a lower pH and an increased [Ca(2+)]. Interestingly, an increasing substrate concentration in the absence of any electron acceptors stabilizes the open conformation as the electrostatic repulsion due to the reaped electrons pushes the DH and CYT domains apart. The accuracy of distance determination was limited mostly by the random fluctuations between replicate measurements, and it was possible to detect movements <1 nm of the domains with respect to each other. The results agreed with calculations using already established models treating conformational changes as contraction or expansion of the thickness of the adsorbate layer (t(protein)). Although the models yielded equivalent results, in this case, the Deltaz(avg)-based method also works in situations, where the adsorbate's mass is not evenly distributed within the layer.",?,Analytical chemistry,Sweden,2020 Feb 4
25889729,Isobutanol production from cellobionic acid in Escherichia coli.,"BACKGROUND: Liquid fuels needed for the global transportation industry can be produced from sugars derived from plant-based lignocellulosics. Lignocellulosics contain a range of sugars, only some of which (such as cellulose) have been shown to be utilizable by microorganisms capable of producing biofuels. Cellobionic acid makes up a small but significant portion of lignocellulosic degradation products, and had not previously been investigated as an utilizable substrate. However, aldonic acids such as cellobionic acid are the primary products of a promising new group of lignocellulosic-degrading enzymes, which makes this compound group worthy of study. Cellobionic acid doesn't inhibit cellulose degradation enzymes and so its inclusion would increase lignocellulosic degradation efficiency. Also, its use would increase overall product yield from lignocellulose substrate. For these reasons, cellobionic acid has gained increased attention for cellulosic biofuel production. RESULTS: This study describes the discovery that Escherichia coli are naturally able to utilize cellobionic acid as a sole carbon source with efficiency comparable to that of glucose and the construction of an E. coli strain able to produce the drop-in biofuel candidate isobutanol from cellobionic acid. The gene primarily responsible for growth of E. coli on cellobionic acid is ascB, a gene previously thought to be cryptic (expressed only after incurring specific mutations in nearby regulatory genes). In addition to AscB, the ascB knockout strain can be complemented by the cellobionic acid phosphorylase from the fungus Neurospora crassa. An E. coli strain engineered to express the isobutanol production pathway was successfully able to convert cellobionic acid into isobutanol. Furthermore, to demonstrate potential application of this strain in a sequential two-step bioprocessing system, E. coli was grown on hydrolysate (that was degraded by a fungus) and was successfully able to produce isobutanol. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that cellobionic acid is a viable carbon source for biofuel production. This work suggests that with further optimization, a bacteria-fungus co-culture could be used in decreased-cost biomass-based biofuel production systems.",?,Microbial cell factories,USA. shddesai@ucdavis.edu,2015 Apr 15
35881801,PRD-2 mediates clock-regulated perinuclear localization of clock gene RNAs within the circadian cycle of Neurospora.,"The transcription-translation negative feedback loops underlying animal and fungal circadian clocks are remarkably similar in their molecular regulatory architecture and, although much is understood about their central mechanism, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of the gene products involved. A common feature of these circadian oscillators is a significant temporal delay between rhythmic accumulation of clock messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding negative arm proteins, for example, frq in Neurospora and Per1-3 in mammals, and the appearance of the clock protein complexes assembled from the proteins they encode. Here, we report use of single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to show that the fraction of nuclei actively transcribing the clock gene frq changes in a circadian manner, and that these mRNAs cycle in abundance with fewer than five transcripts per nucleus at any time. Spatial point patterning statistics reveal that frq is spatially clustered near nuclei in a time of day-dependent manner and that clustering requires an RNA-binding protein, PRD-2 (PERIOD-2), recently shown also to bind to mRNA encoding another core clock component, casein kinase 1. An intrinsically disordered protein, PRD-2 displays behavior in vivo and in vitro consistent with participation in biomolecular condensates. These data are consistent with a role for phase-separating RNA-binding proteins in spatiotemporally organizing clock mRNAs to facilitate local translation and assembly of clock protein complexes.","['Neurospora', 'cell biology', 'circadian rhythms', 'liquid-liquid phase separation', 'smFISH']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,NH 03755,2022 Aug 2
36690295,Nanosized extracellular vesicles released by Neurospora crassa hyphae.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized structures containing proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, released by living cells to the surrounding medium. EVs participate in diverse processes, such as intercellular communication, virulence, and disease. In pathogenic fungi, EVs carry enzymes that allow them to invade the host or undergo environmental adaptation successfully. In Neurospora crassa, a non-pathogenic filamentous fungus widely used as a model organism, the vesicle-dependent secretory mechanisms that lead to polarized growth are well studied. In contrast, biosynthesis of EVs in this fungus has been practically unexplored. In the present work, we analyzed N. crassa culture's supernatant for the presence of EVs by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and proteomic analysis. We identified spherical membranous structures, with a predominant subpopulation averaging a hydrodynamic diameter (d(h)) of 68 nm and a particle diameter (d(p)) of 38 nm. EV samples stained with osmium tetroxide vapors were better resolved than those stained with uranyl acetate. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 252 proteins, including enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes, oxidative stress response, cell wall organization/remodeling, and circadian clock-regulated proteins. Some of these proteins have been previously reported in exosomes from human cells or in EVs of other fungi. In view of the results, it is suggested a putative role for EVs in cell wall biosynthesis and vegetative development in N. crassa.","['Cell wall', 'Extracellular vesicles', 'Filamentous fungi', 'Transmission electron microscopy', 'Vegetative development']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2023 Mar
30278361,Investigation of the role hydrophobin monomer loops using hybrid models via molecular dynamics simulation.,"Hydrophobins are small amphiphilic fungal proteins that are highly surface-active and are used in various industrial applications such as dispersion, immobilization, and antifouling. At hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, hydrophobins tend to self-assemble as rodlets or monolayers, depending on whether they are class I or II. Several studies have determined the three-dimensional structure and investigated the self-assembly formation mechanism of the class I EAS from Neurospora crassa and the class II HFBII from Trichoderma reesei. Although some studies have examined the performance of chimeric hydrophobins, they have not been investigated at the atomic scale. Here, we designed chimeric hydrophobins by grafting the L(1) loop of Vmh2 and the L(3) loop of EAS onto the class II hydrophobin HFBII by homology modeling and performed vacuum-water interface molecular simulations to determine their structural behaviors. We found that the chimeric hydrophobin grafted with the L(3) of EAS became unstable under standard conditions, whereas that grafted with the L(1) of Vmh2 became unstable in the presence of calcium ions. Moreover, when both the EAS L(3) and Vmh2 L(1) were grafted together, the structure became disordered and lost its amphiphilic characteristics in standard conditions. In the presence of calcium, however, its structural stability was restored. However, an additional external perturbation is required to trigger the conformational transition. Although our chimeric hydrophobin models were designed through homology modeling, our results provide detailed information regarding hydrophobin self-assembly and their surface-interactive behavior that may serve as a template for designing hydrophobins for future industrial applications.","['EAS', 'HFBII', 'Hydrophobin', 'Interface', 'Molecular dynamics', 'Vmh2']","Colloids and surfaces.

25711239,Heterologous expression of mitochondria-targeted microbial nitrilase enzymes increases cyanide tolerance in Arabidopsis.,"Anthropogenic activities have resulted in cyanide (CN) contamination of both soil and water in many areas of the globe. While plants possess a detoxification pathway that serves to degrade endogenously generated CN, this system is readily overwhelmed, limiting the use of plants in bioremediation. Genetic engineering of additional CN degradation pathways in plants is one potential strategy to increase their tolerance to CN. Here we show that heterologous expression of microbial nitrilase enzymes targeted to the mitochondria increases CN tolerance in Arabidopsis. Root length in seedlings expressing either a CN dihydratase from Bacillus pumilis or a CN hydratase from Neurospora crassa was increased by 45% relative in wild-type plants in the presence of 50 mum KCN. We also demonstrate that in contrast to its strong inhibitory effects on seedling establishment, seed germination of the Col-0 ecotype of Arabidopsis is unaffected by CN.","['Arabidopsis', 'bioremediation', 'cyanide', 'germination', 'mitochondria', 'nitrilase']","Plant biology (Stuttgart, Germany)",South Africa,2015 Jul
25086358,Heterologous expression and solution structure of defensin from lentil Lens culinaris.,"A new defensin Lc-def, isolated from germinated seeds of the lentil Lens culinaris, has molecular mass 5440.4Da and consists of 47 amino acid residues. Lc-def and its (15)N-labeled analog were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial activity of the recombinant protein was examined, and its spatial structure, dynamics, and interaction with lipid vesicles were studied by NMR spectroscopy. It was shown that Lc-def is active against fungi, but does not inhibit the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The peptide is monomeric in aqueous solution and contains one alpha-helix and triple-stranded beta-sheet, which form cysteine-stabilized alphabeta motif (CSalphabeta) previously found in other plant defensins. The sterically neighboring loop1 and loop3 protrude from the defensin core and demonstrate significant mobility on the mus-ms timescale. Lc-def does not bind to the zwitterionic lipid (POPC) vesicles but interacts with the partially anionic (POPC/DOPG, 7:3) membranes under low-salt conditions. The Lc-def antifungal activity might be mediated through electrostatic interaction with anionic lipid components of fungal membranes.","['Antifungal activity', 'Antimicrobial peptide', 'Defensin', 'Lentil', 'NMR', 'Recombinant expression']",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Russia,2014 Aug 22
28177769,A deletion variant partially complements a porin-less strain of Neurospora crassa.,"Mitochondrial porin, the voltage-dependent anion channel, plays an important role in metabolism and other cellular functions within eukaryotic cells. To further the understanding of porin structure and function, Neurospora crassa wild-type porin was replaced with a deletion variant lacking residues 238-242 (238porin). 238porin was assembled in the mitochondrial outer membrane, but the steady state levels were only about 3% of those of the wild-type protein. The strain harbouring 238porin displayed cytochrome deficiencies and expressed alternative oxidase. Nonetheless, it exhibited an almost normal linear growth rate. Analysis of mitochondrial proteomes from a wild-type strain FGSC9718, a strain lacking porin (DeltaPor-1), and one expressing only 238porin, revealed that the major differences between the variant strains were in the levels of subunits of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the electron transport chain, which were reduced only in the DeltaPor-1 strain. These, and other proteins related to electron flow and mitochondrial biogenesis, are differentially affected by relative porin levels.","['LC-MS/MS', 'Neurospora', 'VDAC', 'alternative oxidase', 'mitochondrial porin', 'oxydase alternative', 'porine mitochondriale']",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,Canada,2017 Apr
31876214,A Comparison of the Neurospora and Drosophila Clocks.,"In Neurospora and other fungi, the protein frequency (FRQ) is an integral part and a negative element in the fungal circadian oscillator. In Drosophila and many other higher organisms, the protein period (PER) is an integral part and a negative element of their circadian oscillator. Employing bioinformatic techniques, such as BLAST, CLUSTAL, and MEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation), 11 regions (sequences) of potential similarity were found between the fungal FRQ and the Drosophila PER. Many of these FRQ regions are conserved in many fungal FRQ(s). Many of these PER regions are conserved in many insects. In addition, these regions are also of biological significance since mutations in these regions lead to changes in the circadian clock of Neurospora and Drosophila. Many of these regions of similarity between FRQ and PER are also conserved between the Drosophila PER and the mouse PER (mPER2). This suggests conserved and important regions for all 3 proteins and a common ancestor, possibly in those amoeba, such as Capsaspora, that sits at the base of the phylogenetic tree where fungi and animals diverged. Two additional examples of a possible common ancestor between Neurospora and Drosophila were found. One, the white collar (WC-1) protein of Neurospora and the Drosophila PER, shows significant similarity in its Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) motifs to the PAS motif of an ARNT-like protein found in the amoeba, Capsaspora. Two, both of the positive elements in each system (i.e., WC-1 in Neurospora and cycle [CYC] in Drosophila), show significant similarity to this Capsaspora ARNT protein. A discussion of these findings centers on the long-time debate about the origins of the many different clock systems (i.e., independent evolution or common ancestor as well as to the question of how new genes are formed).","['ARNT', 'FRQ', 'PER', 'WC-1', 'evolution']",Journal of biological rhythms,California,2020 Apr
32946564,LSD1 prevents aberrant heterochromatin formation in Neurospora crassa.,"Heterochromatin is a specialized form of chromatin that restricts access to DNA and inhibits genetic processes, including transcription and recombination. In Neurospora crassa, constitutive heterochromatin is characterized by trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3, hypoacetylation of histones, and DNA methylation. We explored whether the conserved histone demethylase, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), regulates heterochromatin in Neurospora, and if so, how. Though LSD1 is implicated in heterochromatin regulation, its function is inconsistent across different systems; orthologs of LSD1 have been shown to either promote or antagonize heterochromatin expansion by removing H3K4me or H3K9me respectively. We identify three members of the Neurospora LSD complex (LSDC): LSD1, PHF1, and BDP-1. Strains deficient for any of these proteins exhibit variable spreading of heterochromatin and establishment of new heterochromatin domains throughout the genome. Although establishment of H3K9me3 is typically independent of DNA methylation in Neurospora, instances of DNA methylation-dependent H3K9me3 have been found outside regions of canonical heterochromatin. Consistent with this, the hyper-H3K9me3 phenotype of Deltalsd1 strains is dependent on the presence of DNA methylation, as well as HCHC-mediated histone deacetylation, suggesting that spreading is dependent on some feedback mechanism. Altogether, our results suggest LSD1 works in opposition to HCHC to maintain proper heterochromatin boundaries.",?,Nucleic acids research,USA,2020 Oct 9

27590806,A Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase with Broad Xyloglucan Specificity from the Brown-Rot Fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum and Its Action on Cellulose-Xyloglucan Complexes.,"Fungi secrete a set of glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) to degrade plant polysaccharides. Brown-rot fungi, such as Gloeophyllum trabeum, tend to have few LPMOs, and information on these enzymes is scarce. The genome of G. trabeum encodes four auxiliary activity 9 (AA9) LPMOs (GtLPMO9s), whose coding sequences were amplified from cDNA. Due to alternative splicing, two variants of GtLPMO9A seem to be produced, a single-domain variant, GtLPMO9A-1, and a longer variant, GtLPMO9A-2, which contains a C-terminal domain comprising approximately 55 residues without a predicted function. We have overexpressed the phylogenetically distinct GtLPMO9A-2 in Pichia pastoris and investigated its properties. Standard analyses using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and mass spectrometry (MS) showed that GtLPMO9A-2 is active on cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and xyloglucan. Importantly, compared to other known xyloglucan-active LPMOs, GtLPMO9A-2 has broad specificity, cleaving at any position along the beta-glucan backbone of xyloglucan, regardless of substitutions. Using dynamic viscosity measurements to compare the hemicellulolytic action of GtLPMO9A-2 to that of a well-characterized hemicellulolytic LPMO, NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa revealed that GtLPMO9A-2 is more efficient in depolymerizing xyloglucan. These measurements also revealed minor activity on glucomannan that could not be detected by the analysis of soluble products by HPAEC-PAD and MS and that was lower than the activity of NcLPMO9C. Experiments with copolymeric substrates showed an inhibitory effect of hemicellulose coating on cellulolytic LPMO activity and did not reveal additional activities of GtLPMO9A-2. These results provide insight into the LPMO potential of G. trabeum and provide a novel sensitive method, a measurement of dynamic viscosity, for monitoring LPMO activity. IMPORTANCE: Currently, there are only a few methods available to analyze end products of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) activity, the most common ones being liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Here, we present an alternative and sensitive method based on measurement of dynamic viscosity for real-time continuous monitoring of LPMO activity in the presence of water-soluble hemicelluloses, such as xyloglucan. We have used both these novel and existing analytical methods to characterize a xyloglucan-active LPMO from a brown-rot fungus. This enzyme, GtLPMO9A-2, differs from previously characterized LPMOs in having broad substrate specificity, enabling almost random cleavage of the xyloglucan backbone. GtLPMO9A-2 acts preferentially on free xyloglucan, suggesting a preference for xyloglucan chains that tether cellulose fibers together. The xyloglucan-degrading potential of GtLPMO9A-2 suggests a role in decreasing wood strength at the initial stage of brown rot through degradation of the primary cell wall.",?,Applied and environmental microbiology,Japan,2016 Nov 15
30086830,Partition of Repeat-Induced Point Mutations Reveals Structural Aspects of Homologous DNA-DNA Pairing.,"In some fungi, a premeiotic process known as repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) can accurately identify and mutate nearly all gene-sized DNA repeats present in the haploid germline nuclei. Studies in Neurospora crassa have suggested that RIP detects sequence homology directly between intact DNA double helices, without strand separation and without the participation of RecA-like proteins. Those studies used the aggregated number of RIP mutations as a simple quantitative measure of RIP activity. Additional structural information about homologous DNA-DNA pairing during RIP can be extracted by analyzing spatial distributions of RIP mutations converted into profiles of partitioned RIP propensity (PRP). Further analysis shows that PRP is strongly affected by the topological configuration and the relative positioning of the participating DNA segments. Most notably, pairs of closely positioned repeats produce very distinct PRP profiles depending on whether these repeats are present in the direct or the inverted orientation. Such an effect can be attributed to a topology-dependent redistribution of the supercoiling stress created by the predicted limited untwisting of the DNA segments during pairing. This and other results raise a possibility that such pairing-induced fluctuations in DNA supercoiling can modulate the overall structure and properties of repetitive DNA. Such effects can be particularly strong in the context of long tandem-repeat arrays that are typically present in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions of chromosomes in many species of plants, fungi, and animals, including humans.",?,Biophysical journal,France.

32259457,Codon usage bias affects alpha-amylase mRNA level by altering RNA stability and cytosine methylation patterns in Escherichia coli.,"Codon usage bias exists in almost every organism and is reported to regulate protein translation efficiency and folding. Besides translation, the preliminary role of codon usage bias on gene transcription has also been revealed in some eukaryotes such as Neurospora crassa. In this study, we took as an example the alpha-amylase-coding gene (amyA) and examined the role of codon usage bias in regulating gene expression in the typical prokaryote Escherichia coli. We confirmed the higher translation efficiency on codon-optimized amyA RNAs and found that the RNA level itself was also affected by codon optimization. The decreased RNA level was caused at least in part by altered mRNA stability at the post-transcriptional level. Codon optimization also altered the number of cytosine methylation sites. Examination on dcm knockouts suggested that cytosine methylation may be a minor mechanism adopted by codon bias to regulate gene RNA levels. More studies are required to verify the global effect of codon usage and to reveal its detailed mechanism on transcription.","['DNA cytosine methylation', 'RNA stability', ""biais d'usage des codons"", 'codon usage bias', ""methylation des cytosines de l'ADN"", ""stabilite de l'ARN""]",Canadian journal of microbiology,P.R.

30321182,"Calcium binding of the antifungal protein PAF: Structure, dynamics and function aspects by NMR and MD simulations.","Calcium ions (Ca2+) play an important role in the toxicity of the cysteine-rich and cationic antifungal protein PAF from Penicillium chrysogenum: high extracellular Ca2+ levels reduce the toxicity of PAF in the sensitive model fungus Neurospora crassa in a concentration dependent way. However, little is known about the mechanistic details of the Ca2+ ion impact and the Ca2+ binding capabilities of PAF outside the fungal cell, which might be the reason for the activity loss. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we demonstrated that PAF weakly, but specifically binds Ca2+ ions. MD simulations of PAF predicted one major Ca2+ binding site at the C-terminus involving Asp53 and Asp55, while Asp19 was considered as putative Ca2+ binding site. The exchange of Asp19 to serine had little impact on the Ca2+ binding, however caused the loss of antifungal activity, as was shown in our recent study. Now we replaced the C-terminal aspartates and expressed the serine variant PAFD53S/D55S. The specific Ca2+ binding affinity of PAFD53S/D55S decreased significantly if compared to PAF, whereas the antifungal activity was retained. To understand more details of Ca2+ interactions, we investigated the NMR and MD structure/dynamics of the free and Ca2+-bound PAF and PAFD53S/D55S. Though we found some differences between these protein variants and the Ca2+ complexes, these effects cannot explain the observed Ca2+ influence. In conclusion, PAF binds Ca2+ ions selectively at the C-terminus; however, this Ca2+ binding does not seem to play a direct role in the previously documented modulation of the antifungal activity of PAF.",?,PloS one,Hungary,2018
29625007,Synthetic Gene Network with Positive Feedback Loop Amplifies Cellulase Gene Expression in Neurospora crassa.,"Second-generation or lignocellulosic biofuels are a tangible source of renewable energy, which is critical to combat climate change by reducing the carbon footprint. Filamentous fungi secrete cellulose-degrading enzymes called cellulases, which are used for production of lignocellulosic biofuels. However, inefficient production of cellulases is a major obstacle for industrial-scale production of second-generation biofuels. We used computational simulations to design and implement synthetic positive feedback loops to increase gene expression of a key transcription factor, CLR-2, that activates a large number of cellulases in a filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa. Overexpression of CLR-2 reveals previously unappreciated roles of CLR-2 in lignocellulosic gene network, which enabled simultaneous induction of approximately 50% of 78 lignocellulosic degradation-related genes in our engineered Neurospora strains. This engineering results in dramatically increased cellulase activity due to cooperative orchestration of multiple enzymes involved in the cellulose degradation pathway.

24142928,Regulation of gene expression in Neurospora crassa with a copper responsive promoter.,"Precise control of gene expression is a powerful method to elucidate biological function, and protein overexpression is an important tool for industry and biochemistry. Expression of the Neurospora crassa tcu-1 gene (NCU00830), encoding a high-affinity copper transporter, is tightly controlled by copper availability. Excess copper represses, and copper depletion, via the use of a copper chelator, activates expression. The kinetics of induction and repression of tcu-1 are rapid, and the effects are long lived. We constructed a plasmid carrying the bar gene (for glufosinate selection) fused to the tcu-1 promoter. This plasmid permits the generation of DNA fragments that can direct integration of Ptcu-1 into any desired locus. We use this strategy to integrate Ptcu-1 in front of wc-1, a circadian oscillator and photoreceptor gene. The addition of excess copper to the Ptcu-1::wc-1 strain phenocopies a Deltawc-1 strain, and the addition of the copper chelator, bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, phenocopies a wc-1 overexpression strain. To test whether copper repression can recapitulate the loss of viability that an essential gene knockout causes, we placed Ptcu-1 upstream of the essential gene, hpt-1. The addition of excess copper drastically reduced the growth rate as expected. Thus, this strategy will be useful to probe the biological function of any N. crassa gene through controlled expression.","['bathocuproinedisulfonic acid', 'copper sulfate (CuSO4)', 'gene function', 'protein overexpression', 'regulation of essential genes']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Texas 77843,2013 Dec 9

To address this question, here we carried out comparative structural and functional characterizations of three cellulose-active C4-oxidizing family AA9 LPMOs from the fungus Neurospora crassa, NcLPMO9A (NCU02240), NcLPMO9C (NCU02916), and NcLPMO9D (NCU01050). We solved the three-dimensional structure of copper-bound NcLPMO9A at 1.6-A resolution and found that NcLPMO9A and NcLPMO9C, containing a CBM1 carbohydrate-binding module, bind cellulose more strongly and were less susceptible to inactivation than NcLPMO9D, which lacks a CBM. All three LPMOs were active on tamarind xyloglucan and konjac glucomannan, generating similar products but clearly differing in activity levels. Importantly, in some cases, the addition of phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose (PASC) had a major effect on activity: NcLPMO9A was active on xyloglucan only in the presence of PASC, and PASC enhanced NcLPMO9D activity on glucomannan. Interestingly, the three enzymes also exhibited large differences in their interactions with enzymatic electron donors, which could reflect that they are optimized to act with different reducing partners. All three enzymes efficiently used H(2)O(2) as a cosubstrate, yielding product profiles identical to those obtained in O(2)-driven reactions with PASC, xyloglucan, or glucomannan. Our results indicate that seemingly similar LPMOs act preferentially on different types of copolymeric substructures in the plant cell wall, possibly because these LPMOs are functionally adapted to distinct niches differing in the types of available reductants.","['AA9', 'ascorbic acid', 'dehydrogenase', 'gene multiplicity', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO)', 'plant cell wall', 'protein stability', 'substrate binding', 'substrate specificity']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Norway,2019 Oct 11
25711741,Functional Characterization and Low-Resolution Structure of an Endoglucanase Cel45A from the Filamentous Fungus Neurospora crassa OR74A: Thermostable Enzyme with High Activity Toward Lichenan and beta-Glucan.,"Biomass is the most abundant and short-term renewable natural resource on Earth whose recalcitrance toward enzymatic degradation represents significant challenge for a number of biotechnological applications. The not so abundant but critically necessary class of GH45 endoglucanases constitutes an essential component of tailored industrial enzyme cocktails because they randomly and internally cleave cellulose molecules. Moreover, GH45 glucanases are core constituents of major-brand detergent formulations as well as enzymatic aid components in the cotton processing industry, clipping unwanted cellulosic fibers from cotton (cellulosic)-based tissues. Here we report on a recombinant high-yield Neurospora crassa OR74A NcCel45A production system, a single-band GH45 endoglucanase purification, and a complete enzyme functional characterization. NcCel45A is a bimodular endoglucanase showing maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 60  degrees C, while most active against lichenan and beta-glucans and lesser active toward filter paper, carboxymethylcellulose, and phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. Gluco-oligosaccharide degradation fingerprinting experiments suggest cellopentaose as the minimal length substrate and ThermalFluor studies indicate that NcCel45A displays excellent stability at elevated temperatures up to 70  degrees C and pHs ranging from 5 to 9. Remarkably, we show that NcCel45A is uniquely resistant to a wide-range of organic solvents and small-angle X-ray scattering show a monkey-wrench molecular shape structure in solution, which indicates, unlike to other known cellulases, a non-fully extended conformation, thus conferring solvent protection. These NcCel45A unique enzymatic properties maybe key for specific industrial applications such as cotton fiber processing and detergent formulations.",?,Molecular biotechnology,Brazil,2015 Jun
34633124,Fungal response to abruptly or gradually delivered antifungal agent amphotericin B is growth stage dependent.,"Anthropogenic disturbances pose a multitude of novel challenges to ecosystems. While many experiments have tested effects using abrupt treatment applications, most environmental changes in fact are gradual. Since ecosystem responses might be highly dependent on the temporal nature of stressors, it is crucial to differentiate the effects of abrupt vs gradual treatment application. Antifungal agents, which are widely used in disease control both for humans and in agriculture, are becoming a new class of environmental contaminants. In this study, we examined the effect of a sub-lethal application of one antifungal agent, amphotericin B. We applied different rates of delivery, e.g. gradual and abrupt, and monitored biomass and sporulation of the model fungus Neurospora crassa in a batch culture. Our results demonstrate that: (i) the effect size difference between abrupt and gradual treatments is fungal growth stage dependent and (ii) the gradual treatment clearly had a higher sporulation level compared with all types of abrupt treatments. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the rate of change in environmental change research and point to a new research direction for future global change studies. Furthermore, our results also have important implications for avoiding treatment-induced spore production in agriculture and medical practise.",?,Environmental microbiology,Germany,2021 Dec
25652193,Exploring the potential of fungal arylacetonitrilases in mandelic acid synthesis.,"The application of arylacetonitrilases from filamentous fungi to the hydrolysis of high concentrations of (R,S)-mandelonitrile (100-500 mM) was demonstrated for the first time. Escherichia coli strains expressing the corresponding genes were used as whole-cell catalysts. Nitrilases from Aspergillus niger, Neurospora crassa, Nectria haematococca, and Arthroderma benhamiae (enzymes NitAn, NitNc, NitNh, and NitAb, respectively) exhibited different degrees of enantio- and chemoselectivity (amide formation). Their enantio- and chemoselectivity was increased by increasing pH (from 8 to 9-10) and adding 4-10% (v/v) toluene as the cosolvent. NitAn and NitNc were able to convert an up to 500 mM substrate in batch mode. NitAn formed a very low amount of the by-product, amide (<1% of the total product). This enzyme produced up to >70 g/L of (R)-mandelic acid (e.e. 94.5-95.6%) in batch or fed-batch mode. Its volumetric productivities were the highest in batch mode [571 +/- 32 g/(L d)] and its catalyst productivities in fed-batch mode (39.9 +/- 2.5 g/g of dcw). NitAb hydrolyzed both enantiomers of 100 mM (R,S)-mandelonitrile at pH 5.0 and is therefore promising for the enantioretentive transformation of (S)-mandelonitrile. Sequence analysis suggested that fungal arylacetonitrilases with similar properties (enantioselectivity, chemoselectivity) were clustered together.",?,Molecular biotechnology,vesela@biomed.cas.cz,2015 May
26321254,Codon Usage Influences the Local Rate of Translation Elongation to Regulate Co-translational Protein Folding.,"Codon usage bias is a universal feature of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and has been proposed to regulate translation efficiency, accuracy, and protein folding based on the assumption that codon usage affects translation dynamics. The roles of codon usage in translation, however, are not clear and have been challenged by recent ribosome profiling studies. Here we used a Neurospora cell-free translation system to directly monitor the velocity of mRNA translation. We demonstrated that the preferred codons enhance the rate of translation elongation, whereas non-optimal codons slow elongation. Codon usage also controls ribosome traffic on mRNA. These conclusions were supported by ribosome profiling results in vitro and in vivo with template mRNAs designed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we demonstrate that codon usage regulates protein function by affecting co-translational protein folding. These results resolve a long-standing fundamental question and suggest the existence of a codon usage code for protein folding.",?,Molecular cell,USA,2015 Sep 3
28717646,Genetic Variation and Its Reflection on Posttranslational Modifications in Frequency Clock and Mating Type a-1 Proteins in Sordaria fimicola.,"Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) occur in all essential proteins taking command of their functions. There are many domains inside proteins where modifications take place on side-chains of amino acids through various enzymes to generate different species of proteins. In this manuscript we have, for the first time, predicted posttranslational modifications of frequency clock and mating type a-1 proteins in Sordaria fimicola collected from different sites to see the effect of environment on proteins or various amino acids pickings and their ultimate impact on consensus sequences present in mating type proteins using bioinformatics tools. Furthermore, we have also measured and walked through genomic DNA of various Sordaria strains to determine genetic diversity by genotyping the short sequence repeats (SSRs) of wild strains of S. fimicola collected from contrasting environments of two opposing slopes (harsh and xeric south facing slope and mild north facing slope) of Evolution Canyon (EC), Israel. Based on the whole genome sequence of S. macrospora, we targeted 20 genomic regions in S. fimicola which contain short sequence repeats (SSRs). Our data revealed genetic variations in strains from south facing slope and these findings assist in the hypothesis that genetic variations caused by stressful environments lead to evolution.",?,BioMed research international,Pakistan,2017
35333354,H3K56 deacetylation and H2A.Z deposition are required for aberrant heterochromatin spreading.,"Crucial mechanisms are required to restrict self-propagating heterochromatin spreading within defined boundaries and prevent euchromatic gene silencing. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the JmjC domain protein DNA METHYLATION MODULATOR-1 (DMM-1) prevents aberrant spreading of heterochromatin, but the molecular details remain unknown. Here, we revealed that DMM-1 is highly enriched in a well-defined 5-kb heterochromatin domain upstream of the cat-3 gene, hereby called 5H-cat-3 domain, to constrain aberrant heterochromatin spreading. Interestingly, aberrant spreading of the 5H-cat-3 domain observed in the dmm-1KO strain is accompanied by robust deposition of histone variant H2A.Z, and deletion of H2A.Z abolishes aberrant spreading of the 5H-cat-3 domain into adjacent euchromatin. Furthermore, lysine 56 of histone H3 is deacetylated at the expanded heterochromatin regions, and mimicking H3K56 acetylation with an H3K56Q mutation effectively blocks H2A.Z-mediated aberrant spreading of the 5H-cat-3 domain. Importantly, genome-wide analyses demonstrated the general roles of H3K56 deacetylation and H2A.Z deposition in aberrant spreading of heterochromatin. Together, our results illustrate a previously unappreciated regulatory process that mediates aberrant heterochromatin spreading.",?,Nucleic acids research,China,2022 Apr 22
32022309,Phosphatidic acid produced by phospholipase D is required for hyphal cell-cell fusion and fungal-plant symbiosis.,"Although lipid signaling has been shown to serve crucial roles in mammals and plants, little is known about this process in filamentous fungi. Here we analyze the contribution of phospholipase D (PLD) and its product phosphatidic acid (PA) in hyphal morphogenesis and growth of Epichloe festucae and Neurospora crassa, and in the establishment of a symbiotic interaction between E. festucae and Lolium perenne. Growth of E. festucae and N. crassa PLD deletion strains in axenic culture, and for E. festucae in association with L. perenne, were analyzed by light-, confocal- and electron microscopy. Changes in PA distribution were analyzed in E. festucae using a PA biosensor and the impact of these changes on the endocytic recycling and superoxide production investigated. We found that E. festucae PldB, and the N. crassa ortholog, PLA-7, are required for polarized growth and cell fusion and contribute to ascospore development, whereas PldA/PLA-8 are dispensable for these functions. Exogenous addition of PA rescues the cell-fusion phenotype in E. festucae. PldB is also crucial for E. festucae to establish a symbiotic association with L. perenne. This study identifies a new component of the cell-cell communication and cell fusion signaling network for hyphal morphogenesis and growth of filamentous fungi.","['Epichloe festucae', 'Neurospora crassa', 'cell-cell fusion', 'mutualism', 'phosphatidic acid', 'phospholipase D', 'sexual development']",Molecular microbiology,New Zealand,2020 Jun
32794524,Effects of soluble dietary fiber from soybean residue fermented by Neurospora crassa on the intestinal flora in rats.,"In this study, soluble dietary fiber (SDF, including oligosaccharides and polysaccharides) of soybean residue (SR) fermented by Neurospora crassa was used as a research object. In vitro fermentation technology was used to analyze the fermentation properties of SDF from fermented soybean residue (FSR). Moreover, the effects of SDF from FSR on the composition and diversity of intestinal microflora of rats were studied by high-throughput sequencing technology. Results showed that the SDF content of fermented soybean residue was 27.21%. The addition of SDF in the range 2 to 10 g L-1 could increase the levels of gas production and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as decrease the pH and ammonia N concentration after 24 h fermentation in the fermentation broth compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The animal-based experiments showed that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the major dominant phyla in all the groups. Compared with the control group, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides of FSR changed the relative abundance and diversity of the bacterial community, and increased the numbers of beneficial flora, such as Prevotellaceae and Lactobacillales. It was shown that SDF of SR fermented by Neurospora crassa had great effects on the intestinal environment and the composition of intestinal flora in rats.",?,Food & function,China. yaweifan@ncu.edu.cn lihongyan@ncu.edu.cn,2020 Sep 23
23539622,Biochemical characterization of molybdenum cofactor-free nitrate reductase from Neurospora crassa.,"Nitrate reductase (NR) is a complex molybdenum cofactor (Moco)-dependent homodimeric metalloenzyme that is vitally important for autotrophic organism as it catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of nitrate assimilation. Beside Moco, eukaryotic NR also binds FAD and heme as additional redox active cofactors, and these are involved in electron transfer from NAD(P)H to the enzyme molybdenum center where reduction of nitrate to nitrite takes place. We report the first biochemical characterization of a Moco-free eukaryotic NR from the fungus Neurospora crassa, documenting that Moco is necessary and sufficient to induce dimer formation. The molybdenum center of NR reconstituted in vitro from apo-NR and Moco showed an EPR spectrum identical to holo-NR. Analysis of mutants unable to bind heme or FAD revealed that insertion of Moco into NR occurs independent from the insertion of any other NR redox cofactor. Furthermore, we showed that at least in vitro the active site formation of NR is an autonomous process.","['Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)', 'Heme', 'Molybdenum', 'Molybdenum Cofactor', 'Neurospora', 'Nitrate Reductase', 'Prosthetic Group Insertion', 'Ultracentrifugation']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Germany,2013 May 17
32869294,Expression of the translation termination factor eRF1 is autoregulated by translational readthrough and 3'UTR intron-mediated NMD in Neurospora crassa.,"Eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) is a translation termination factor that binds to the ribosome at stop codons. The expression of eRF1 is strictly controlled, since its concentration defines termination efficiency and frequency of translational readthrough. Here, we show that eRF1 expression in Neurospora crassa is controlled by an autoregulatory circuit that depends on the specific 3'UTR structure of erf1 mRNA. The stop codon context of erf1 promotes readthrough that protects the mRNA from its 3'UTR-induced nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). High eRF1 concentration leads to inefficient readthrough, thereby allowing NMD-mediated erf1 degradation. We propose that eRF1 expression is controlled by similar autoregulatory circuits in many fungi and seed plants and discuss the evolution of autoregulatory systems of different translation termination factors.","['autoregulation', 'convergent evolution', 'eukaryotic Release Factor 1', 'nonsense-mediated decay', 'readthrough', 'translation termination']",FEBS letters,Hungary,2020 Nov
28933279,Zinc Transporter Protein (tzn-1) May Also Play a Role in Conidiation Pathway of Neurospora crassa: An Insight Using Proteogenomic Approach.,"BACKGROUND: Zinc transporter (tzn-1) of Neurospora crassa plays a crucial role in conidiation pathway, as its removal results in aconidiation which was reported in our earlier studies. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to analyze the role of tzn-1 in conidiation process, by comparing knockout (KO) mutants zinc transporter KO (Deltatzn-1) and aconidiating gene KO (Deltaacon-3) with wild oak ridge (OR) 74 'A' strain by 'Proteo-genomic' approach. METHODS: To identify the commonly expressed protein spots in knockout (KO) mutants zinc transporter KO (Deltatzn-1) and aconidiating gene KO (Deltaacon-3) by comparing with wild oak ridge (OR) 74 'A' strain. Two sets (Deltatzn-1 to wild and Deltaacon-3 to wild) were analyzed by combining 2- Dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) with Matrix Associated Laser Desortion/Ionization mass spectrometry -Peptide Mass Fingerprint (MALDI-PMF). Then, the peptide sequences which were obtained by MASCOT (database software) were identified by FGSC BLASTp search analysis. Finally, to evaluate the expression of the KO mutants zinc transporter KO (Deltatzn-1) and aconidiating gene KO (Deltaacon-3) in comparison to wild (OR) 74 'A' type was analyzed by Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) studies. RESULTS: 2DE and MALDI-PMF has shown the nine commonly overexpressed protein spots from the two sets (Deltatzn-1 to wild and Deltaacon-3 to wild). Peptide sequences were obtained by MASCOT (database software) analysis and peptide sequences were identified by FGSC BLASTp search. Eight sequences have shown the similarities with the genes involved during the early stages of conidial and sexual development. Our qRT-PCR analysis has shown that tzn-1 gene was upregulated in contrast to acon-3 gene in absence of iron concentration and down regulated with increase in iron concentrations in wild samples. With increase in zinc supplements, the tzn-1 gene is normally regulated and shown contrasting feature in absence of zinc and acon-3 gene is normally regulated both in presence and absence of zinc. At regular time intervals, declined growth rate was observed after 18hours of induction. CONCLUSION: Thus, we conclude that tzn-1 and acon-3 genes were actively participating in early stages of conidial process and metal ions play some crucial role in the development of the organism.","['2DE', 'FGSC BLASTp and qRT-PCR,', 'MALDI-PMF', 'MASCOT', 'Zinc transporter (tzn-1)']",Protein and peptide letters,India,2018 Feb 8
30017938,Experimental measurement of endocytosis in fungal hyphae.,"The present study examines the notion that polarized exocytosis in the tips of growing hyphae creates an excess of plasma membrane and thus the need for its removal by endocytosis. To measure endocytosis experimentally, we developed a photobleaching (FRAP) procedure to count endocytic events in hyphae of Neurospora crassa carrying a fluorescent tag on the actin-binding protein fimbrin (FIM-1-GFP). Given 40â€¯nm as the average diameter of endocytic vesicles, we calculated that about 12.5% of the plasma membrane discharged in the apex becomes endocytosed in the subapex. According to our calculations, the GFP-tagged hyphae of N. crassa, measured under the constrained conditions of confocal microscopic examination, needed about 8800 vesicles/min to extend their plasma membrane or about 9800/min, if we include predicted demands for cell wall growth and extracellular secretion. Our findings support the notion that exocytosis and endocytosis operate in tandem with the latter serving as a compensatory process to remove any excess of plasma membrane generated by the intense exocytosis in the hyphal tips. Presumably, this tandem arrangement evolved to support the hallmark features of fungi namely rapid cell extension and abundant secretion of hydrolytic enzymes.","['Cell wall synthesis', 'Endocytosis', 'Exocytosis', 'Plasma membrane', 'Vesicles']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico,2018 Sep
26481444,The N-acetylglucosamine catabolic gene cluster in Trichoderma reesei is controlled by the Ndt80-like transcription factor RON1.,"Chitin is an important structural constituent of fungal cell walls composed of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) monosaccharides, but catabolism of GlcNAc has not been studied in filamentous fungi so far. In the yeast Candida albicans, the genes encoding the three enzymes responsible for stepwise conversion of GlcNAc to fructose-6-phosphate are clustered. In this work, we analysed GlcNAc catabolism in ascomycete filamentous fungi and found that the respective genes are also clustered in these fungi. In contrast to C. albicans, the cluster often contains a gene for an Ndt80-like transcription factor, which we named RON1 (regulator of N-acetylglucosamine catabolism 1). Further, a gene for a glycoside hydrolase 3 protein related to bacterial N-acetylglucosaminidases can be found in the GlcNAc gene cluster in filamentous fungi. Functional analysis in Trichoderma reesei showed that the transcription factor RON1 is a key activator of the GlcNAc gene cluster and essential for GlcNAc catabolism. Furthermore, we present an evolutionary analysis of Ndt80-like proteins in Ascomycota. All GlcNAc cluster genes, as well as the GlcNAc transporter gene ngt1, and an additional transcriptional regulator gene, csp2, encoding the homolog of Neurospora crassa CSP2/GRHL, were functionally characterised by gene expression analysis and phenotypic characterisation of knockout strains in T. reesei.",?,Molecular microbiology,Austria,2016 Feb
29547124,Codon usage biases co-evolve with transcription termination machinery to suppress premature cleavage and polyadenylation.,"Codon usage biases are found in all genomes and influence protein expression levels. The codon usage effect on protein expression was thought to be mainly due to its impact on translation. Here, we show that transcription termination is an important driving force for codon usage bias in eukaryotes. Using Neurospora crassa as a model organism, we demonstrated that introduction of rare codons results in premature transcription termination (PTT) within open reading frames and abolishment of full-length mRNA. PTT is a wide-spread phenomenon in Neurospora, and there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage bias and PTT events. Rare codons lead to the formation of putative poly(A) signals and PTT. A similar role for codon usage bias was also observed in mouse cells. Together, these results suggest that codon usage biases co-evolve with the transcription termination machinery to suppress premature termination of transcription and thus allow for optimal gene expression.","['Neurospora', 'codon usage', 'evolutionary biology', 'genomics', 'neurospora', 'transcription termination']",eLife,United States,2018 Mar 16

35306147,Extracellular targeting of Neurospora crassa cell wall and secreted glycoproteins by DFG-5.,"The formation of a cell wall is vital for the survival and growth of a fungal cell. Fungi express members of the GH76 family of alpha-1,6-mannanases which play an important role in cell wall biogenesis. In this report we characterize the Neurospora crassa DFG-5 alpha-1,6-mannanase and demonstrate that it binds to the alpha-1,6-mannose backbone of an N-linked galactomannan found on cell wall glycoproteins. We show that DFG-5 has an enzymatic activity and provide evidence that it processes the alpha-1,6-mannose backbone of the N-linked galactomannan. Site-directed mutagenesis and complementation experiments show that D116 and D117 are located at the DFG-5 active site. D76 and E130, which are located in a groove on the opposite side of the protein, are also important for enzyme function. Cell wall glycoproteins co-purify with DFG-5 demonstrating a specific association between DFG-5 and cell wall glycoproteins. DFG-5 is able to discriminate between cell wall and secreted glycoproteins, and does not bind to the N-linked galactomannans present on secreted glycoproteins. DFG-5 plays a key role in targeting extracellular glycoproteins to their final destinations. By processing the galactomannans on cell wall proteins, DFG-5 targets them for cell wall incorporation by lichenin transferases. The N-linked galactomannans on secreted proteins are not processed by DFG-5, which targets these proteins for release into the extracellular medium.","['Cell wall biosynthesis', 'DFG5', 'Extracellular protein targeting', 'GH76 alpha-1,6-mannanase', 'Galactomannan', 'Protein secretion']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,United States,2022 May

Recently, we identified regulatorof cell death-1 (rcd-1), a gene controlling PCD in germinated asexual spores in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassarcd-1 alleles are highly polymorphic and fall into two haplogroups in N. crassa populations. Coexpression of alleles from the two haplogroups, rcd-1-1 and rcd-1-2, is necessary and sufficient to trigger a cell death reaction. Here, we investigated the molecular bases of rcd-1-dependent cell death. Based on in silico analyses, we found that RCD-1 is a remote homolog of the N-terminal pore-forming domain of gasdermin, the executioner protein of a highly inflammatory cell death reaction termed pyroptosis, which plays a key role in mammalian innate immunity. We show that RCD-1 localizes to the cell periphery and that cellular localization of RCD-1 was correlated with conserved positively charged residues on predicted amphipathic alpha-helices, as shown for murine gasdermin-D. Similar to gasdermin, RCD-1 binds acidic phospholipids in vitro, notably, cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine, and interacts with liposomes containing such lipids. The RCD-1 incompatibility system was reconstituted in human 293T cells, where coexpression of incompatible rcd-1-1/rcd-1-2 alleles triggered pyroptotic-like cell death. Oligomers of RCD-1 were associated with the cell death reaction, further supporting the evolutionary relationship between gasdermin and rcd-1 This report documents an ancient transkingdom relationship of cell death execution modules involved in organismal defense.","['Neurospora', 'gasdermin', 'innate immunity', 'programmed cell death', 'pyroptosis']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CA 94720; asen.daskalov@u-bordeaux.fr Lglass@berkeley.edu,2020 Aug 4

32697972,An optimized QF-binary expression system for use in zebrafish.,"The zebrafish model organism has been of exceptional utility for the study of vertebrate development and disease through the application of tissue-specific labelling and overexpression of genes carrying patient-derived mutations. However, there remains a need for a binary expression system that is both non-toxic and not silenced over animal generations by DNA methylation. The Q binary expression system derived from the fungus Neurospora crassa is ideal, because the consensus binding site for the QF transcription factor lacks CpG dinucleotides, precluding silencing by CpG-meditated methylation. To optimize this system for zebrafish, we systematically tested several variants of the QF transcription factor: QF full length; QF2, which lacks the middle domain; QF2(w), which is an attenuated version of QF2; and chimeric QFGal4. We found that full length QF and QF2 were strongly toxic to zebrafish embryos, QF2(w) was mildly toxic, and QFGal4 was well tolerated, when injected as RNA or expressed ubiquitously from stable transgenes. In addition, QFGal4 robustly activated a Tg(QUAS:GFP(NLS)) reporter transgene. To increase the utility of this system, we also modified the QF effector sequence termed QUAS, which consists of five copies of the QF binding site. Specifically, we decreased both the CpG dinucleotide content, as well as the repetitiveness of QUAS, to reduce the risk of transgene silencing via CpG methylation. Moreover, these modifications to QUAS removed leaky QF-independent neural expression that we detected in the original QUAS sequence. To demonstrate the utility of our QF optimizations, we show how the Q-system can be used for lineage tracing using a Cre-dependent Tg(ubi:QFGal4-switch) transgene. We also demonstrate that QFGal4 can be used in transient injections to tag and label endogenous genes by knocking in QFGal4 into sox2 and ubiquitin C genes.","['Binary expression system', 'Gal4', 'Gene tagging', 'Knock-in', 'Lineage tracing', 'Q-system', 'QF', 'QUAS', 'Zebrafish']",Developmental biology,Canada,2020 Sep 15

The recombinant BGL2 enzyme displayed its highest activity at pH 5.0 and 60  degrees C, and had its maximum activity against p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) (143.27 +/- 4.79 U/mg), followed by cellobiose (74.99 +/- 0.78 U/mg), gentiobiose (47.55 +/- 0.15 U/mg), p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside (pNPC) (40.07 +/- 0.87 U/mg), cellotriose (12.31 +/- 0.36 U/mg) and cellotetraose (9.04 +/- 0.14 U/mg). The kinetic parameters of Km and Vmax were 0.21 +/- 0.01 mM and 147.93 +/- 2.77 muM/mg/min for pNPG. The purified enzyme showed a heightened ability to convert the major soybean isoflavone glycosides (daidzin, genistin and glycitin) into their corresponding aglycone forms (daidzien, genistein and glycitein). With this activity against soybean isoflavone glycosides, BGL2 shows great potential for applications in the food, animal feed, and pharmaceutical industries.","['Isoflavone glycosides', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Pichia pastoris', 'beta-glucosidase']",Protein expression and purification,China,2016 Mar
29930292,A conditional silencing suppression system for transient expression.,"RNA silencing is a powerful tool deployed by plants against viral infection and abnormal gene expression. Plant viruses have evolved a suite of silencing suppressors for counter-defense, which are also widely used to boost transcript and protein accumulation in transient assays. However, only wild type silencing suppressor proteins have been reported to date. Here we demonstrate that P0 of Potato leafroll virus (PLRV), PLP0, can be split into two proteins that only show silencing suppression activity upon co-expression. We cloned each of these proteins in two different constructs and transiently co-infiltrated them in N. benthamiana leaves. We expressed a fluorescent protein from one of the vectors and observed that cells expressing both halves of PLP0 suppressed gene silencing. Further, we showed that Q system of Neurospora crassa, based on co-expression of a transcription activator and inhibitor, is functional in agroinfiltrated leaves of N. benthamiana. Q system combined with the split PLP0 system showed very tight co-expression of Q system's transcriptional activator and inhibitor. Altogether, our experiments demonstrate a functioning conditional silencing suppressor system and its potential as a powerful tool for transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves, as well as the application of the Q system in plants.",?,Scientific reports,Switzerland.

26801962,Antifungal mechanisms of a plant defensin MtDef4 are not conserved between the ascomycete fungi Neurospora crassa and Fusarium graminearum.,"Defensins play an important role in plant defense against fungal pathogens. The plant defensin, MtDef4, inhibits growth of the ascomycete fungi, Neurospora crassa and Fusarium graminearum, at micromolar concentrations. We have reported that MtDef4 is transported into the cytoplasm of these fungi and exerts its antifungal activity on intracellular targets. Here, we have investigated whether the antifungal mechanisms of MtDef4 are conserved in these fungi. We show that N. crassa and F. graminearum respond differently to MtDef4 challenge. Membrane permeabilization is required for the antifungal activity of MtDef4 against F. graminearum but not against N. crassa. We find that MtDef4 is targeted to different subcellular compartments in each fungus. Internalization of MtDef4 in N. crassa is energy-dependent and involves endocytosis. By contrast, MtDef4 appears to translocate into F. graminearum autonomously using a partially energy-dependent pathway. MtDef4 has been shown to bind to the phospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA). We provide evidence that the plasma membrane localized phospholipase D, involved in the biosynthesis of PA, is needed for entry of this defensin in N. crassa, but not in F. graminearum. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a defensin which inhibits the growth of two ascomycete fungi via different mechanisms.",?,Molecular microbiology,USA,2016 May
31235519,Substrate selectivity in starch polysaccharide monooxygenases.,"Degradation of polysaccharides is central to numerous biological and industrial processes. Starch-active polysaccharide monooxygenases (AA13 PMOs) oxidatively degrade starch and can potentially be used with industrial amylases to convert starch into a fermentable carbohydrate. The oxidative activities of the starch-active PMOs from the fungi Neurospora crassa and Myceliophthora thermophila, NcAA13 and MtAA13, respectively, on three different starch substrates are reported here. Using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometry detection, we observed that both enzymes have significantly higher oxidative activity on amylose than on amylopectin and cornstarch. Analysis of the product distribution revealed that NcAA13 and MtAA13 more frequently oxidize glycosidic linkages separated by multiples of a helical turn consisting of six glucose units on the same amylose helix. Docking studies identified important residues that are involved in amylose binding and suggest that the shallow groove that spans the active-site surface of AA13 PMOs favors the binding of helical amylose substrates over nonhelical substrates. Truncations of NcAA13 that removed its native carbohydrate-binding module resulted in diminished binding to amylose, but truncated NcAA13 still favored amylose oxidation over other starch substrates. These findings establish that AA13 PMOs preferentially bind and oxidize the helical starch substrate amylose. Moreover, the product distributions of these two enzymes suggest a unique interaction with starch substrates.","['amylose', 'auxiliary activity (AA) enzyme', 'carbohydrate-binding protein', 'copper', 'copper monooxygenase', 'metalloprotein', 'oxygenase', 'polysaccharide', 'polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'starch']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Vietnam.

25747495,Clerodane type diterpene as a novel antifungal agent from Polyalthia longifolia var. pendula.,"Bioactivity-guided chemical examination of methanolic extract of leaves of Polyalthia longifolia var. pendula led to the isolation of the active constituent, a diterpene 1 which was identified as 16alpha-hydroxycleroda-3,13(14)Z-dien-15,16-olide on the basis of its spectral data. Among the tested strains, diterpene 1 was found to exhibit antifungal activities having MIC90 values of 50.3, 100.6 and 201.2 muM against Candida albicans NCIM3557, Cryptococcus neoformans NCIM3542 (human pathogens) and Neurospora crassa NCIM870 (saprophyte), respectively. Initial, structure-activity-relationship (SAR) data generated by synthesizing some derivatives revealed that the double bond between C3-C4 and the free hydroxyl group at C16 are crucial for the antifungal activity of the diterpene 1. The mode of action of 1 in C. albicans is due to compromised cell membrane permeability and also probably due to disruption of cell wall structures. The red blood cell haemolysis of all the compounds (1-4) did not show any significant haemolysis and was found to be less than 15% for all the compounds when tested at highest concentration, i.e. 1200 muM. Interestingly, all the tested compounds inhibited Y-H transition in dimorphic C. albicans NCIM3557 at much lower concentration than their MIC90 values. Determination of ROS generation by diterpene 1 using DCFH-DA and DHR123 (dihydrorhodamine) staining of C. albicans NCIM3557 indicated production of intracellular ROS as a mechanism of antifungal activity.","['Antifungal activity', 'Diterpene', 'Flash chromatography', 'Isolation', 'Natural products', 'Polyalthia longifolia']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,India.

27628707,Recombination-independent recognition of DNA homology for repeat-induced point mutation.,"Numerous cytogenetic observations have shown that homologous chromosomes (or individual chromosomal loci) can engage in specific pairing interactions in the apparent absence of DNA breakage and recombination, suggesting that canonical recombination-mediated mechanisms may not be the only option for sensing DNA/DNA homology. One proposed mechanism for such recombination-independent homology recognition involves direct contacts between intact double-stranded DNA molecules. The strongest in vivo evidence for the existence of such a mechanism is provided by the phenomena of homology-directed DNA modifications in fungi, known as repeat-induced point mutation (RIP, discovered in Neurospora crassa) and methylation-induced premeiotically (MIP, discovered in Ascobolus immersus). In principle, Neurospora RIP can detect the presence of gene-sized DNA duplications irrespectively of their origin, underlying nucleotide sequence, coding capacity or relative, as well as absolute positions in the genome. Once detected, both sequence copies are altered by numerous cytosine-to-thymine (C-to-T) mutations that extend specifically over the duplicated region. We have recently shown that Neurospora RIP does not require MEI-3, the only RecA/Rad51 protein in this organism, consistent with a recombination-independent mechanism. Using an ultra-sensitive assay for RIP mutation, we have defined additional features of this process. We have shown that RIP can detect short islands of homology of only three base-pairs as long as many such islands are arrayed with a periodicity of 11 or 12 base-pairs along a pair of DNA molecules. While the presence of perfect homology is advantageous, it is not required: chromosomal segments with overall sequence identity of only 35-36 % can still be recognized by RIP. Importantly, in order for this process to work efficiently, participating DNA molecules must be able to co-align along their lengths. Based on these findings, we have proposed a model, in which sequence homology is detected by direct interactions between slightly-extended double-stranded DNAs. As a next step, it will be important to determine if the uncovered principles also apply to other processes that involve recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomal loci in vivo as well as to protein-free DNA/DNA interactions that were recently observed under biologically relevant conditions in vitro.","['DNA', 'Homologous pairing', 'Homology recognition', 'Mutation', 'RIP', 'Recombination-independent']",Current genetics,USA. eugene.gladyshev@gmail.com,2017 Jun

Here, we describe the heterologous expression of four fungal LAAOs in Pichia pastoris. cgLAAO1 from Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and ncLAAO1 from Neurospora crassa were able to convert substrates not recognized by recombinant 9His-hcLAAO4 from the fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum described earlier thereby broadening the substrate spectrum for potential applications. 9His-frLAAO1 from Fibroporia radiculosa and 9His-laLAAO2 from Laccaria amethystine were obtained only in low amounts. All four enzymes were N-glycosylated. We generated mutants of 9His-hcLAAO4 lacking N-glycosylation sites to further understand the effects of N-glycosylation. All four predicted N-glycosylation sites were glycosylated in 9His-hcLAAO4 expressed in P. pastoris. Enzymatic activity was similar for fully glycosylated 9His-hcLAAO4 and variants without one or all N-glycosylation sites after acid activation of all samples. However, activity without acid treatment was low in a variant without N-glycans. This was caused by the absence of a hypermannosylated N-glycan on asparagine residue N54. The lack of one or all of the other N-glycans was without effect. Our results demonstrate that adoption of a more active conformation requires a specific N-glycosylation during biosynthesis.","['Pichia pastoris', 'fungi', 'glycosylation', 'heterologous expression', 'l-amino acid oxidases']",MicrobiologyOpen,Germany,2021 Aug
25549622,Probing C-terminal interactions of the Pseudomonas stutzeri cyanide-degrading CynD protein.,"The cyanide dihydratases from Bacillus pumilus and Pseudomonas stutzeri share high amino acid sequence similarity throughout except for their highly divergent C-termini. However, deletion or exchange of the C-termini had different effects upon each enzyme. Here we extended previous studies and investigated how the C-terminus affects the activity and stability of three nitrilases, the cyanide dihydratases from B. pumilus (CynDpum) and P. stutzeri (CynDstut) and the cyanide hydratase from Neurospora crassa. Enzymes in which the C-terminal residues were deleted decreased in both activity and thermostability with increasing deletion lengths. However, CynDstut was more sensitive to such truncation than the other two enzymes. A domain of the P. stutzeri CynDstut C-terminus not found in the other enzymes, 306GERDST311, was shown to be necessary for functionality and explains the inactivity of the previously described CynDstut-pum hybrid. This suggests that the B. pumilus C-terminus, which lacks this motif, may have specific interactions elsewhere in the protein, preventing it from acting in trans on a heterologous CynD protein. We identify the dimerization interface A-surface region 195-206 (A2) from CynDpum as this interaction site. However, this A2 region did not rescue activity in C-terminally truncated CynDstutDelta302 or enhance the activity of full-length CynDstut and therefore does not act as a general stability motif.",?,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,USA,2015 Apr
25670706,The role of Cercospora zeae-maydis homologs of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 1O2-resistance genes in resistance to the photoactivated toxin cercosporin.,"The photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides and plant pathogenic fungus Cercospora nicotianae have been used as models for understanding resistance to singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)), a highly toxic reactive oxygen species. In Rhodobacter and Cercospora, (1)O(2) is derived, respectively, from photosynthesis and from the (1)O(2)-generating toxin cercosporin which the fungus produces to parasitize plants. We identified common genes recovered in transcriptome studies of putative (1)O(2)-resistance genes in these two systems, suggesting common (1)O(2)-resistance mechanisms. To determine if the Cercospora homologs of R. sphaeroides (1)O(2)-resistance genes are involved in resistance to cercosporin, we expressed the genes in the cercosporin-sensitive fungus Neurospora crassa and assayed for increases in cercosporin resistance. Neurospora crassa transformants expressing genes encoding aldo/keto reductase, succinyl-CoA ligase, O-acetylhomoserine (thiol) lyase, peptide methionine sulphoxide reductase and glutathione S-transferase did not have elevated levels of cercosporin resistance. Several transformants expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase were significantly more resistant to cercosporin. Expression of the transgene and enzyme activity did not correlate with resistance, however. We conclude that although the genes tested in this study are important in (1)O(2) resistance in R. sphaeroides, their Cercospora homologs are not involved in resistance to (1)O(2) generated from cercosporin.","['Cercospora', 'O-acetylhomoserine (thiol) lyase', 'Rhodobacter', 'aldehyde dehydrogenase', 'aldo/keto reductase', 'cercosporin', 'glutathione S-transferase', 'peptide methionine sulphoxide reductase', 'singlet oxygen', 'succinyl-CoA ligase']",FEMS microbiology letters,USA,2015 Jan
24790223,CDC-42 and RAC-1 regulate opposite chemotropisms in Neurospora crassa.,"Cell polarization and fusion are crucial developmental processes that occur in response to intracellular and extracellular signals. Asexual spores (conidia) of the mold Neurospora crassa differentiate two types of polarized cell protrusions, germ tubes and conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs), which exhibit negative and positive chemotropism, respectively. We provide the first evidence that shared and separate functions of the Rho-type GTPases CDC-42 and RAC-1 regulate these opposite chemotropisms. We demonstrate that RAC-1 is essential for CAT formation and cell fusion, whereas CDC-42 is necessary and sufficient for normal germ tube development. Cdc42-Rac-interactive-binding (CRIB) reporters were constructed to exclusively label locally activated GTP-bound GTPases. Time course analyses showed that repositioning of these activated GTPase clusters within germ tube and CAT tip apices controls directional growth in the absence of a tip-localized vesicle supply center (Spitzenkorper). We propose a model in which the local assembly of a plasma-membrane-associated GTPase-PAK-MAPK signaling platform regulates chemoattractant perception and secretion in order to synchronize oscillatory cell-cell communication and directional CAT tip growth.","['CDC-42', 'CRIB', 'Cell fusion', 'Chemotropism', 'Conidial anastomosis tube', 'Directional tip growth', 'Neurospora crassa', 'RAC-1']",Journal of cell science,UK,2014 May 1
24710172,The RNA helicase FRH is an ATP-dependent regulator of CK1a in the circadian clock of Neurospora crassa.,"The Neurospora clock protein FRQ forms a complex with casein kinase 1a (CK1a) and FRH, a DEAD box-containing RNA helicase with a clock-independent essential function in RNA metabolism. In the course of a circadian period, FRQ is progressively hyperphosphorylated and eventually degraded. Timed hyperphosphorylation of FRQ is crucial for timekeeping of the clock. Here we show that the ATPase activity of FRH attenuates the kinetics of CK1a-mediated hyperphosphorylation of FRQ. Hyperphosphorylation of FRQ is strictly dependent on site-specific recruitment of a CK1a molecule that is activated upon binding. The FRH ATPase cycle regulates the access of CK1a to phosphorylation sites in FRQ in cis, suggesting that FRH is an ATP-dependent remodelling factor acting on the protein complex. We show that the affinity of CK1a for FRQ decreases with increasing FRQ phosphorylation, suggesting functional inactivation of FRQ in the negative feedback loop of the circadian clock before and independent of its degradation.",?,Nature communications,Germany,2014 Apr 7
27076460,ISEA: Iterative Seed-Extension Algorithm for De Novo Assembly Using Paired-End Information and Insert Size Distribution.,"The purpose of de novo assembly is to report more contiguous, complete, and less error prone contigs. Thanks to the advent of the next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the cost of producing high depth reads is reduced greatly. However, due to the disadvantages of NGS, de novo assembly has to face the difficulties brought by repeat regions, error rate, and low sequencing coverage in some regions. Although many de novo algorithms have been proposed to solve these problems, the de novo assembly still remains a challenge. In this article, we developed an iterative seed-extension algorithm for de novo assembly, called ISEA. To avoid the negative impact induced by error rate, ISEA utilizes reads overlap and paired-end information to correct error reads before assemblying. During extending seeds in a De Bruijn graph, ISEA uses an elaborately designed score function based on paired-end information and the distribution of insert size to solve the repeat region problem. By employing the distribution of insert size, the score function can also reduce the influence of error reads. In scaffolding, ISEA adopts a relaxed strategy to join contigs that were terminated for low coverage during the extension. The performance of ISEA was compared with six previous popular assemblers on four real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ISEA can effectively obtain longer and more accurate scaffolds.",?,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,,2017 Jul-Aug
23818262,How catalase recognizes H(2)O(2) in a sea of water.,"Monofunctional heme-catalases have been studied for many decades but there is still an incomplete understanding of why such a large tetrameric protein with deeply buried active sites is required to accomplish such a simple reaction as H2 O2 dismutation. Catalase accomplishes this reaction at a high rate although water at 55 M is expected to compete with H2 O2 for the enzyme's active site. Using molecular dynamics simulations we addressed the question as to how catalase selects H2 O2 in water. Selection is accomplished through different mechanisms: higher residence time of H2 O2 in the vicinity of certain prevalent amino acid residues at the protein surface and substrate channel, coordinated motion of the main passage amino acids that is increased in the presence of H2 O2 , a gate valve mechanism consisting of the motion of two contiguous phenylalanine residues that drive water molecules out of the final section of the substrate channel, a hydrophobic barrier before the active site that was crossed more easily by H2 O2 which kept most of its hydrogen bonds while passing, and finally an increased residence time for H2 O2 at the active site. These mechanisms, based on the physicochemical differences between H2 O2 and water, provide an explanation as to why such a large tetrameric protein with deeply buried active sites is required to accomplish efficient H2 O2 dismutation.","['molecular dynamics', 'motion coordination', 'protein channels', 'solvent/protein interactions', 'structure/function']",Proteins,Mexico,2014 Jan

On a hydrophobic substrate, NC2 forms layers consisting of an ordered network of protein molecules, which dramatically decrease the water contact angle. The solution structure and dynamics of NC2 have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure of this protein displays the same core fold as observed in other hydrophobin structures determined to date, including the Class II hydrophobins HFBI and HFBII from Trichoderma reesei, but certain features illuminate the structural differences between Classes I and II hydrophobins and also highlight the variations between structures of Class II hydrophobin family members.

32898933,Calcium homeostasis plays important roles in the internalization and activities of the small synthetic antifungal peptide PAF26.,"Fungal diseases are responsible for the deaths of over 1.5 million people worldwide annually. Antifungal peptides represent a useful source of antifungals with novel mechanisms-of-action, and potentially provide new methods of overcoming resistance. Here we investigate the mode-of-action of the small, rationally designed synthetic antifungal peptide PAF26 using the model fungus Neurospora crassa. Here we show that the cell killing activity of PAF26 is dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) and the presence of fully functioning fungal Ca(2+) homeostatic/signaling machinery. In a screen of mutants with deletions in Ca(2+) -signaling machinery, we identified three mutants more tolerant to PAF26. The Ca(2+) ATPase NCA-2 was found to be involved in the initial interaction of PAF26 with the cell envelope. The vacuolar Ca(2+) channel YVC-1 was shown to be essential for its accumulation and concentration within the vacuolar system. The Ca(2+) channel CCH-1 was found to be required to prevent the translocation of PAF26 across the plasma membrane. In the wild type, Ca(2+) removal from the medium resulted in the peptide remaining trapped in small vesicles as in the Deltayvc-1 mutant. It is, therefore, apparent that cell killing by PAF26 is complex and unusually dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) and components of the Ca(2+) -regulatory machinery.","['PAF26', 'antifungal peptides', 'antimicrobial agents', 'calcium signalling', 'mechanisms of action', 'resistance']",Molecular microbiology,Scotland,2020 Oct

We showed previously that antisense transcription triggers Dicer-independent siRNA (disiRNA) production and disiRNA locus DNA methylation (DLDM) in Neurospora crassa Here we show that the conserved exonuclease ERI-1 (enhanced RNAi-1) is a critical component in this process. Antisense transcription and ERI-1 binding to target RNAs are necessary and sufficient to trigger DLDM. Convergent transcription causes stalling of RNA polymerase II during transcription, which permits ERI-1 to bind nascent RNAs in the nucleus and recruit a histone methyltransferase complex that catalyzes chromatin modifications. Furthermore, we show that, in the cytoplasm, ERI-1 targets hundreds of transcripts from loci without antisense transcription to regulate RNA stability. Together, our results demonstrate a critical role for transcription kinetics in long noncoding RNA-mediated epigenetic modifications and identify ERI-1 as an important regulator of cotranscriptional gene silencing and post-transcriptional RNA metabolism.","['DNA methylation', 'Neurospora', 'antisense transcription', 'gene silencing', 'small RNA']",Genes & development,USA,2016 Nov 1
27652512,Isomorphic coalescence of aster cores formed in vitro from microtubules and kinesin motors.,"We report fluorescence microscopy studies of the formation of aster-like structures emerging from a cellular element-based active system and a novel analysis of the aster condensation. The system consists of rhodamine labeled microtubules which are dynamically coupled by functionalized kinesin motor proteins cross-linked via streptavidin-coated quantum dots (QDs). The aster-shaped objects contain core structures. The cores are aggregates of the QD-motor protein complexes, and result from the dynamic condensation of sub-clusters that are connected to each other randomly. The structural specificity of the aster core reflects a configuration of the initial connectivity between sub-clusters. Detailed image analysis allows us to extract a novel correlation between the condensation speed and the sub-cluster separation. The size of the core is scaled down during the condensation process, following a power law dependence on the distance between sub-clusters. The exponent of the power law is close to two, as expected from a geometric model. This single exponent common to all the contractile lines implies that there exists a time regime during which an isomorphic contraction of the aster core continues during the condensation process. We analyze the observed contraction by using a model system with potential applicability in a wide range of emergent phenomena in randomly coupled active networks, which are prevalent in the cellular environment.",?,Physical biology,Japan,2016 Sep 21
27531696,"Suppressor of fusion, a Fusarium oxysporum homolog of Ndt80, is required for nutrient-dependent regulation of anastomosis.","Heterokaryon formation is an essential step in asexual recombination in Fusarium oxysporum.

In Neurospora crassa, Vib-1, a putative transcription factor of the p53-like Ndt80 family of transcription factors, has been identified as global regulator of HI. In this study we investigated the role of the F. oxysporum homolog of Vib-1, called Suf, in vegetative hyphal and conidial anastomosis tube (CAT) fusion and HI. We identified a novel function for an Ndt80 homolog as a nutrient-dependent regulator of anastomosis. Strains carrying the SUF deletion mutation display a hyper-fusion phenotype during vegetative growth as well as germling development. In addition, conidial paring of incompatible SUF deletion strains led to more heterokaryon formation, which is independent of suppression of HI. Our data provides further proof for the divergence in the functions of different members Ndt80 family.

33234686,Heterotrimeric G-Protein Signaling Is Required for Cellulose Degradation in Neurospora crassa.,"The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa decomposes lignocellulosic biomass to generate soluble sugars as carbon sources. In this study, we investigated a role for heterotrimeric G-protein signaling in cellulose degradation. Loss of the Galpha subunit genes gna-1 and gna-3, the Gbeta subunit genes gnb-1 and cpc-2, the Ggamma gene gng-1, or the gene for downstream effector adenylyl cyclase (cr-1) resulted in loss of detectable cellulase activity. This defect was also observed in strains expressing a constitutively active version of gna-3 (gna-3(Q208L) ). We found that GNA-1 levels are greatly reduced in Deltagna-3, Deltagnb-1, and Deltagng-1 strains, likely contributing to cellulase defects in these genetic backgrounds. The observation that gna-3(Q208L) Deltagnb-1 strains exhibit cellulase activity, despite greatly reduced levels of GNA-1 protein, is consistent with positive control of cellulase production by GNA-3 that is manifested in the absence of gnb-1 Expression patterns for five cellulase genes showed that Deltagna-1, Deltagnb-1, and Deltagna-3 mutants produce less cellulase mRNA than the wild type, consistent with transcriptional regulation. Deltacpc-2 mutants had wild-type levels of cellulase transcripts, suggesting posttranscriptional control. In contrast, results for Deltacr-1 mutants support both transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of cellulase activity by cAMP signaling. Cellulase activity defects in Deltagna-3 mutants were fully remediated by cAMP supplementation, consistent with GNA-3 operating upstream of cAMP signaling. In contrast, cAMP addition only partially corrected cellulase activity defects in Deltagna-1 and Deltagnb-1 mutants, suggesting participation of GNA-1 and GNB-1 in additional cAMP-independent pathways that control cellulase activity.IMPORTANCE Filamentous fungi are critical for the recycling of plant litter in the biosphere by degrading lignocellulosic biomass into simpler compounds for metabolism. Both saprophytic and pathogenic fungi utilize plant cell wall-degrading enzymes to liberate carbon for metabolism. Several studies have demonstrated a role for cellulase enzymes during infection of economically relevant crops by fungal pathogens. Especially in developing countries, severe plant disease means loss of entire crops, sometimes leading to starvation. In this study, we demonstrate that G-protein signaling is a key component of cellulase production. Therefore, understanding the role of G-protein signaling in the regulation of the unique metabolism of cellulose by these organisms can inform innovations in strain engineering of industrially relevant species for biofuel production and in combatting food shortages caused by plant pathogens.","['G proteins', 'cell signaling', 'cellulolytic enzymes', 'cyclic AMP', 'filamentous fungi', 'lignocellulose', 'molecular genetics']",mBio,USA,2020 Nov 24
33046504,Plasma Membrane Fusion Is Specifically Impacted by the Molecular Structure of Membrane Sterols During Vegetative Development of Neurospora crassa.,"Cell-to-cell fusion is crucial for the development and propagation of most eukaryotic organisms. Despite this importance, the molecular mechanisms mediating this process are only poorly understood in biological systems. In particular, the step of plasma membrane merger and the contributing proteins and physicochemical factors remain mostly unknown. Earlier studies provided the first evidence of a role of membrane sterols in cell-to-cell fusion. By characterizing different ergosterol biosynthesis mutants of the fungus Neurospora crassa, which accumulate different ergosterol precursors, we show that the structure of the sterol ring system specifically affects plasma membrane merger during the fusion of vegetative spore germlings. Genetic analyses pinpoint this defect to an event prior to engagement of the fusion machinery. Strikingly, this effect is not observed during sexual fusion, suggesting that the specific sterol precursors do not generally block membrane merger, but rather impair subcellular processes exclusively mediating fusion of vegetative cells. At a colony-wide level, the altered structure of the sterol ring system affects a subset of differentiation processes, including vegetative sporulation and steps before and after fertilization during sexual propagation. Together, these observations corroborate the notion that the accumulation of particular sterol precursors has very specific effects on defined cellular processes rather than nonspecifically disturbing membrane functioning. Given the phenotypic similarities of the ergosterol biosynthesis mutants of N. crassa during vegetative fusion and of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells undergoing mating, our data support the idea that yeast mating is evolutionarily and mechanistically more closely related to vegetative than sexual fusion of filamentous fungi.","['Neurospora crassa', 'cell fusion', 'ergosterol', 'mating', 'plasma membrane fusion']",Genetics,Germany,2020 Dec

Thus, M. robertsii can be used as a representative to simultaneously study several major lifestyles that are not shared by the ""model"" fungi Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa; a systematic genetic analysis of M. robertsii will benefit studies in other fungi. In order to systematically disrupt genes in M. robertsii, we developed a high-throughput gene disruption methodology, which includes two technologies. One is the modified OSCAR-based, high-throughput construction of gene disruption plasmids. This technology involves two donor plasmids (pA-Bar-OSCAR with the herbicide resistance genes Bar and pA-Sur-OSCAR with another herbicide resistance gene Sur) and a recipient binary plasmid pPK2-OSCAR-GFP that was produced by replacing the Bar cassette in pPK2-bar-GFP with a ccdB cassette and recombination recognition sites. Using this technology, a gene disruption plasmid can be constructed in one cloning step in two days. The other is a highly efficient gene disruption technology based on homologous recombination using a Ku70 deletion mutant (DeltaMrKu70) as the recipient strain. The deletion of MrKu70, a gene encoding a key component involved in nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair in fungi, dramatically increases the gene disruption efficiency. The frequency of disrupting the conidiation-associated gene Cag8 in DeltaMrKu70 was 93% compared to 7% in the wild-type strain. Since DeltaMrKu70 is not different from the wild-type strain in development, pathogenicity and tolerance to various abiotic stresses, it can be used as a recipient strain for a systematic gene disruption project to characterize the whole suite of genes involved in the biological processes of M. robertsii.",?,PloS one,China,2014
24173035,Eukaryotic resistance to fluoride toxicity mediated by a widespread family of fluoride export proteins.,"Fluorine is an abundant element and is toxic to organisms from bacteria to humans, but the mechanisms by which eukaryotes resist fluoride toxicity are unknown. The Escherichia coli gene crcB was recently shown to be regulated by a fluoride-responsive riboswitch, implicating it in fluoride response. There are >8,000 crcB homologs across all domains of life, indicating that it has an important role in biology. Here we demonstrate that eukaryotic homologs [renamed FEX (fluoride exporter)] function in fluoride export. FEX KOs in three eukaryotic model organisms, Neurospora crassa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans, are highly sensitized to fluoride (>200-fold) but not to other halides. Some of these KO strains are unable to grow in fluoride concentrations found in tap water. Using the radioactive isotope of fluoride, (18)F, we developed an assay to measure the intracellular fluoride concentration and show that the FEX deletion strains accumulate fluoride in excess of the external concentration, providing direct evidence of FEX function in fluoride efflux. In addition, they are more sensitive to lower pH in the presence of fluoride. These results demonstrate that eukaryotic FEX genes encode a previously unrecognized class of fluoride exporter necessary for survival in standard environmental conditions.","['dual membrane topology', 'environmental toxin', 'ion transport', 'toxicity resistance']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CT 06520,2013 Nov 19
35744816,Precise Quantification of Molybdate In Vitro by the FRET-Based Nanosensor 'MolyProbe'.,"Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential trace element in all kingdoms of life. Mo is bioavailable as the oxyanion molybdate and gains biological activity in eukaryotes when bound to molybdopterin, forming the molybdenum cofactor. The imbalance of molybdate homeostasis results in growth deficiencies or toxic symptoms within plants, fungi and animals. Recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods have emerged, monitoring cellular and subcellular molybdate distribution dynamics using a genetically encoded molybdate-specific FRET nanosensor, named MolyProbe. Here, we show that the MolyProbe system is a fast and reliable in vitro assay for quantitative molybdate determination. We added a Strep-TagII affinity tag to the MolyProbe protein for quick and easy purification. This MolyProbe is highly stable, resistant to freezing and can be stored for several weeks at 4  degrees C. Furthermore, the molybdate sensitivity of the assay peaked at low nM levels. Additionally, The MolyProbe was applied in vitro for quantitative molybdate determination in cell extracts of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the fungus Neurospora crassa and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results show the functionality of the Arabidopsis thaliana molybdate transporter MOT1.1 and indicate that FRET-based molybdate detection is an excellent tool for measuring bioavailable Mo.","['MolyProbe', 'fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET', 'molybdenum homeostasis', 'molybdenum metabolism']","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",Germany,2022 Jun 8
25201969,A family of starch-active polysaccharide monooxygenases.,"The recently discovered fungal and bacterial polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs) are capable of oxidatively cleaving chitin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses that contain beta(1-->4) linkages between glucose or substituted glucose units. They are also known collectively as lytic PMOs, or LPMOs, and individually as AA9 (formerly GH61), AA10 (formerly CBM33), and AA11 enzymes. PMOs share several conserved features, including a monocopper center coordinated by a bidentate N-terminal histidine residue and another histidine ligand. A bioinformatic analysis using these conserved features suggested several potential new PMO families in the fungus Neurospora crassa that are likely to be active on novel substrates. Herein, we report on NCU08746 that contains a C-terminal starch-binding domain and an N-terminal domain of previously unknown function. Biochemical studies showed that NCU08746 requires copper, oxygen, and a source of electrons to oxidize the C1 position of glycosidic bonds in starch substrates, but not in cellulose or chitin. Starch contains alpha(1-->4) and alpha(1-->6) linkages and exhibits higher order structures compared with chitin and cellulose. Cellobiose dehydrogenase, the biological redox partner of cellulose-active PMOs, can serve as the electron donor for NCU08746. NCU08746 contains one copper atom per protein molecule, which is likely coordinated by two histidine ligands as shown by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and sequence analysis. Results indicate that NCU08746 and homologs are starch-active PMOs, supporting the existence of a PMO superfamily with a much broader range of substrates. Starch-active PMOs provide an expanded perspective on studies of starch metabolism and may have potential in the food and starch-based biofuel industries.","['CBM20', 'copper enzymes', 'oxygen activation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CA 92037,2014 Sep 23
27443927,Transcriptional regulation using the Q system in transgenic zebrafish.,"Methods to label cell populations selectively or to modify their gene expression are critical tools in the study of developmental or physiological processes in vivo. A variety of approaches have been applied to the zebrafish model, capitalizing on Tol2 transposition to generate transgenic lines with high efficiency. Here we describe the adoption of the Q system of Neurospora crassa, which includes the QF transcription factor and the upstream activating sequence (QUAS) to which it binds. These components function as a bipartite regulatory system similar to that of yeast Gal4/UAS, producing robust expression in transient assays of zebrafish embryos injected with plasmids and in stable transgenic lines. An important advantage, however, is that QUAS-regulated transgenes appear far less susceptible to transcriptional silencing even after seven generations. This chapter describes some of the Q system reagents that have been developed for zebrafish, as well as the use of the QF transcription factor for isolation of tissue-specific driver lines from gene/enhancer trap screens. Additional strategies successfully implemented in invertebrate models, such as a truncated QF transcription factor (QF2) or the reassembly of a split QF, are also discussed. The provided information, and available Gateway-based vectors, should enable those working with the zebrafish model to implement the Q system with minimal effort or to use it in combination with Gal4, Cre, or other regulatory systems for further refinement of transcriptional control.","['Bipartite system', 'Gal4', 'Transcriptional regulation', 'Transgenesis', 'qalocus']",Methods in cell biology,United States,2016
29078403,Induction of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation by tethered heterochromatin factors in Neurospora crassa.,"Functionally different chromatin domains display distinct chemical marks. Constitutive heterochromatin is commonly associated with trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), hypoacetylated histones, and DNA methylation, but the contributions of and interplay among these features are not fully understood. To dissect the establishment of heterochromatin, we investigated the relationships among these features using an in vivo tethering system in Neurospora crassa Artificial recruitment of the H3K9 methyltransferase DIM-5 (defective in methylation-5) induced H3K9me3 and DNA methylation at a normally active, euchromatic locus but did not bypass the requirement of DIM-7, previously implicated in the localization of DIM-5, indicating additional DIM-7 functionality. Tethered heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) induced H3K9me3, DNA methylation, and gene silencing. The induced heterochromatin required histone deacetylase 1 (HDA-1), with an intact catalytic domain, but HDA-1 was not essential for de novo heterochromatin formation at native heterochromatic regions. Silencing did not require H3K9me3 or DNA methylation. However, DNA methylation contributed to establishment of H3K9me3 induced by tethered HP1. Our analyses also revealed evidence of regulatory mechanisms, dependent on HDA-1 and DIM-5, to control the localization and catalytic activity of the DNA methyltransferase DIM-2. Our study clarifies the interrelationships among canonical aspects of heterochromatin and supports a central role of HDA-1-mediated histone deacetylation in heterochromatin spreading and gene silencing.","['DNA methylation', 'H3K9 methylation', 'HP1', 'heterochromatin', 'histone deacetylation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,OR 97403,2017 Nov 7
28640690,A new layer of rRNA regulation by small interference RNAs and the nuclear RNAi pathway.,"Ribosome biogenesis drives cell growth and proliferation, but mechanisms that modulate this process remain poorly understood. For a long time, small rRNA sequences have been widely treated as non-specific degradation products and neglected as garbage sequences. Recently, we identified a new class of antisense ribosomal siRNAs (risiRNAs) that downregulate pre-rRNA through the nuclear RNAi pathway in C. elegans. risiRNAs exhibit sequence characteristics similar to 22G RNA while complement to 18S and 26S rRNA. risiRNAs elicit the translocation of the nuclear Argonaute protein NRDE-3 from the cytoplasm to nucleus and nucleolus, in which the risiRNA/NRDE complex binds to pre-rRNA and silences rRNA expression. Interestingly, when C. elegans is exposed to environmental stimuli, such as cold shock and ultraviolet illumination, risiRNAs accumulate and further turn on the nuclear RNAi-mediated gene silencing pathway. risiRNA may act in a quality control mechanism of rRNA homeostasis. When the exoribonuclease SUSI-1(ceDis3L2) is mutated, risiRNAs are dramatically increased. In this Point of View article, we will summarize our understanding of the small antisense ribosomal siRNAs in a variety of organisms, especially C. elegans, and their possible roles in the quality control mechanism of rRNA homeostasis.","['NRDE', 'nucleolus', 'rRNA', 'risiRNA', 'stress']",RNA biology,P.R.

34815343,Structure of the translating Neurospora ribosome arrested by cycloheximide.,"Ribosomes translate RNA into proteins. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) is widely used to inhibit eukaryotic ribosomes engaged in translation elongation. However, the lack of structural data for actively translating polyribosomes stalled by CHX leaves unanswered the question of which elongation step is inhibited. We elucidated CHX's mechanism of action based on the cryo-electron microscopy structure of actively translating Neurospora crassa ribosomes bound with CHX at 2.7-A resolution. The ribosome structure from this filamentous fungus contains clearly resolved ribosomal protein eL28, like higher eukaryotes but unlike budding yeast, which lacks eL28. Despite some differences in overall structures, the ribosomes from Neurospora, yeast, and humans all contain a highly conserved CHX binding site. We also sequenced classic Neurospora CHX-resistant alleles. These mutations, including one at a residue not previously observed to affect CHX resistance in eukaryotes, were in the large subunit proteins uL15 and eL42 that are part of the CHX-binding pocket. In addition to A-site transfer RNA (tRNA), P-site tRNA, messenger RNA, and CHX that are associated with the translating N. crassa ribosome, spermidine is present near the CHX binding site close to the E site on the large subunit. The tRNAs in the peptidyl transferase center are in the A/A site and the P/P site. The nascent peptide is attached to the A-site tRNA and not to the P-site tRNA. The structural and functional data obtained show that CHX arrests the ribosome in the classical PRE translocation state and does not interfere with A-site reactivity.","['cryo-electron microscopy', 'protein synthesis', 'translation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,TX 77843,2021 Nov 30
31025135,Efficient production of xylitol by the integration of multiple copies of xylose reductase gene and the deletion of Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway-associated genes to enhance NADPH regeneration in Escherichia coli.,"Cofactor supply is a rate-limiting step in the bioconversion of xylose to xylitol. Strain WZ04 was first constructed by a novel simultaneous deletion-insertion strategy, replacing ptsG, xylAB and ptsF in wild-type Escherichia coli W3110 with three mutated xylose reductase genes (xr) from Neurospora crassa. Then, the pfkA, pfkB, pgi and/or sthA genes were deleted and replaced by xr to investigate the influence of carbon flux toward the pentose phosphate pathway and/or transhydrogenase activity on NADPH generation. The deletion of pfkA/pfkB significantly improved NADPH supply, but minimally influenced cell growth. The effects of insertion position and copy number of xr were examined by a quantitative real-time PCR and a shake-flask fermentation experiment. In a fed-batch fermentation experiment with a 15-L bioreactor, strain WZ51 produced 131.6 g L(-1) xylitol from hemicellulosic hydrolysate (xylitol productivity: 2.09 g L(-1) h(-1)). This study provided a potential approach for industrial-scale production of xylitol from hemicellulosic hydrolysate.","['CRISPR/Cas9', 'Cofactor regeneration', 'Hemicellulosic hydrolysate', 'Multicopy integration', 'Xylitol']",Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,People's Republic of China,2019 Aug

In this study, photo morphogenesis and the blue-light receptor gene were studied using five representative strains of C. militaris. The results suggest that light was essential for colony pigmentation and could promote conidia production. Cmwc-1, the homologe of the blue-light photoreceptor of Neurospora crassa, was cloned from the genome of C. militaris by Hi-tail PCR. The protein CmWC-1 was characterized by the presence of the LOV and PAS domains and a GATA-type Znf domain. Genetic variation analysis of Cmwc-1 in different strains showed that 15-bp deletions occurred in three strains that resulted in 5-Gln deletions in the transcription activation domain. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Sordariomycetes WC-1-like proteins suggested that the sequence of WC-1 could be used as a candidate marker for phylogenetic analysis in fungi. Cmwc-1 mRNA was light inducible and the expression level increased significantly after irradiation in all tested strains. The sequence of CmWC-1 and the relative expressions responding to irradiation in degenerate and albino strains were similar as the cultivated one. This report will help to open the still-unexplored field of stroma development for this fungus.","['Cordyceps mushroom', 'albino', 'degenerate strain', 'light', 'white collar-1']",FEMS microbiology letters,China,2014 Mar
31996719,Comparative study of the interactions between fungal transcription factor nuclear localization sequences with mammalian and fungal importin-alpha.,"Importin-alpha (Impalpha) is an adaptor protein that binds to cargo proteins (containing Nuclear Localization Sequences - NLSs), for their translocation to the nucleus. The specificities of the Impalpha/NLS interactions have been studied, since these features could be used as important tools to find potential NLSs in nuclear proteins or even for the development of targets to inhibit nuclear import or to design peptides for drug delivery. Few structural studies have compared different Impalpha variants from the same organism or Impalpha of different organisms. Previously, we investigated nuclear transport of transcription factors with Neurospora crassa Impalpha (NcImpalpha). Herein, NIT-2 and PAC-3 transcription factors NLSs were studied in complex with Mus musculus Impalpha (MmImpalpha). Calorimetric assays demonstrated that the PAC-3 NLS peptide interacts with both Impalpha proteins with approximately the same affinity. The NIT-2 NLS sequence binds with high affinity to the Impalpha major binding site from both organisms, but its binding to minor binding sites reveals interesting differences due to the presence of additional interactions of NIT-2-NLS with MmImpalpha. These findings, together with previous results with Impalpha from other organisms, indicate that the differential affinity of NLSs to minor binding sites may be also responsible for the selectivity of some cargo proteins recognition and transport.",?,Scientific reports,Brazil,2020 Jan 29
31672687,"Class V chitin synthase and beta(1,3)-glucan synthase co-travel in the same vesicle in Zymoseptoria tritici.","The fungal cell wall consists of proteins and polysaccharides, formed by the co-ordinated activity of enzymes, such as chitin or glucan synthases. These enzymes are delivered via secretory vesicles to the hyphal tip. In the ascomycete Neurospora crassa, chitin synthases and beta(1,3)-glucan synthase are transported in different vesicles, whereas they co-travel along microtubules in the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis. This suggests fundamental differences in wall synthesis between taxa. Here, we visualize the class V chitin synthase ZtChs5 and the beta(1,3)-glucan synthase ZtGcs1 in the ascomycete Zymoseptoria tritici. Live cell imaging demonstrate that both enzymes co-locate to the apical plasma membrane, but are not concentrated in the Spitzenkorper. Delivery involves co-transport along microtubules of the chitin and glucan synthase. Live cell imaging and electron microscopy suggest that both cell wall synthases locate in the same vesicle. Thus, microtubule-dependent co-delivery of cell wall synthases in the same vesicle is found in asco- and basidiomycetes.","['Cell wall formation', 'Chitin synthases', 'Glucan synthase', 'Membrane trafficking']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,UK,2020 Feb

CAT-2 had the Met-Tyr-Trp (M-Y-W) adduct required for catalase activity. Its K(M) for H(2)O(2) was micromolar for peroxidase and millimolar for catalase activity. A E(m) = -158 mV reduction potential value was obtained and the Soret band shift suggested a mixture of low and high spin ferric iron. CAT-2 EPR spectrum at 10 K indicated an axial and a rhombic component. With peroxyacetic acid (PAA), formation of Compound I* was observed with EPR. CAT-2 homodimer crystallographic structure contained two K(+) ions; Glu107 residues were displaced to bind them. CAT-2 showed the essential amino acid residues for activity in similar positions to other CPs. CAT-2 Arg426 is oriented towards the M-Y-W adduct, interacting with the deprotonated Tyr238 hydroxyl group. A perhydroxy modification of the indole nitrogen of Trp90 was oriented toward the catalytic His91. In contrast to cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, the catalase-peroxidase heme propionates are not exposed to the solvent.

24733907,Discovery of LPMO activity on hemicelluloses shows the importance of oxidative processes in plant cell wall degradation.,"The recently discovered lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are known to carry out oxidative cleavage of glycoside bonds in chitin and cellulose, thus boosting the activity of well-known hydrolytic depolymerizing enzymes. Because biomass-degrading microorganisms tend to produce a plethora of LPMOs, and considering the complexity and copolymeric nature of the plant cell wall, it has been speculated that some LPMOs may act on other substrates, in particular the hemicelluloses that tether to cellulose microfibrils. We demonstrate that an LPMO from Neurospora crassa, NcLPMO9C, indeed degrades various hemicelluloses, in particular xyloglucan. This activity was discovered using a glycan microarray-based screening method for detection of substrate specificities of carbohydrate-active enzymes, and further explored using defined oligomeric hemicelluloses, isolated polymeric hemicelluloses and cell walls. Products generated by NcLPMO9C were analyzed using high performance anion exchange chromatography and multidimensional mass spectrometry. We show that NcLPMO9C generates oxidized products from a variety of substrates and that its product profile differs from those of hydrolytic enzymes acting on the same substrates. The enzyme particularly acts on the glucose backbone of xyloglucan, accepting various substitutions (xylose, galactose) in almost all positions. Because the attachment of xyloglucan to cellulose hampers depolymerization of the latter, it is possible that the beneficial effect of the LPMOs that are present in current commercial cellulase mixtures in part is due to hitherto undetected LPMO activities on recalcitrant hemicellulose structures.","['CBM33', 'GH61', 'biorefinery', 'metallo enzymes']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Norway,2014 Apr 29

31138651,Evidence for distinct rate-limiting steps in the cleavage of alkenes by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases.,"Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) use a nonheme Fe(II) cofactor to split alkene bonds of carotenoid and stilbenoid substrates. The iron centers of CCDs are typically five-coordinate in their resting states, with solvent occupying an exchangeable site. The involvement of this iron-bound solvent in CCD catalysis has not been experimentally addressed, but computational studies suggest two possible roles. 1) Solvent dissociation provides a coordination site for O(2), or 2) solvent remains bound to iron but changes its equilibrium position to allow O(2) binding and potentially acts as a proton source. To test these predictions, we investigated isotope effects (H(2)O versus D(2)O) on two stilbenoid-cleaving CCDs, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans oxygenase 2 (NOV2) and Neurospora crassa carotenoid oxygenase 1 (CAO1), using piceatannol as a substrate. NOV2 exhibited an inverse isotope effect (k(H)/k(D)  approximately  0.6) in an air-saturated buffer, suggesting that solvent dissociates from iron during the catalytic cycle. By contrast, CAO1 displayed a normal isotope effect (k(H)/k(D)  approximately  1.7), suggesting proton transfer in the rate-limiting step. X-ray absorption spectroscopy on NOV2 and CAO1 indicated that the protonation states of the iron ligands are unchanged within pH 6.5-8.5 and that the Fe(II)-aquo bond is minimally altered by substrate binding. We pinpointed the origin of the differential kinetic behaviors of NOV2 and CAO1 to a single amino acid difference near the solvent-binding site of iron, and X-ray crystallography revealed that the substitution alters binding of diffusible ligands to the iron center. We conclude that solvent-iron dissociation and proton transfer are both associated with the CCD catalytic mechanism.","['O2 activation', 'X-ray absorption spectroscopy', 'carotenoid', 'crystallography', 'dioxygenase', 'enzyme kinetics', 'iron', 'non-heme iron', 'solvent isotope effect', 'stilbenoid']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Ohio 44106,2019 Jul 5
26476643,The blue-light receptor CmWC-1 mediates fruit body development and secondary metabolism in Cordyceps militaris.,"Light is an essential factor for pigment formation and fruit body development in Cordyceps militaris, a well-known edible and medicinal fungus. Cmwc-1, a homolog of the blue-light receptor gene white collar-1 (wc-1) in Neurospora crassa, was cloned from the C. militaris genome in our previous study. Here, Cmwc-1 gene inactivation results in thicker aerial hyphae, disordered fruit body development, a significant reduction in conidial formation, and carotenoid and cordycepin production. These characteristics were restored when the DeltaCmwc-1 strains were hybridized with wild-type strains of the opposite mating type. A genome-wide expression analysis revealed that there were 1042 light-responsive genes in the wild-type strain and only 458 in the DeltaCmwc-1 strain. Among five putative photoreceptors identified, Vivid, cryptochrome-1, and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase are strongly induced by light in a Cmwc-1-dependent manner, while phytochrome and cryptochrome-2 were not induced. The transcription factors involved in the fungal light reaction were mainly of the Zn2Cys6 type. CmWC-1 regulates adenylosuccinate synthase, an important enzyme for adenosine de novo synthesis, which could explain the reduction in cordycepin production. Some G protein-coupled receptors that control fungal fruit body formation and the sexual cycle were regulated by CmWC-1, and the cAMP pathway involved in light signal transduction in N. crassa was not critical for the photoreaction in the fungus here. A transcriptional analysis indicated that steroid biosynthesis was more active in the DeltaCmwc-1 strain, suggesting that CmWC-1 might switch the vegetative growth state to primordia differentiation by suppressing the expression of related genes.","['Carotenoid', 'Cmwc-1', 'Cordycepin', 'Cordyceps militaris', 'Fruit body']",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,China,2016 Jan
26647184,period-1 encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that influences nutritional compensation of the Neurospora circadian clock.,"Mutants in the period-1 (prd-1) gene, characterized by a recessive allele, display a reduced growth rate and period lengthening of the developmental cycle controlled by the circadian clock. We refined the genetic location of prd-1 and used whole genome sequencing to find the mutation defining it, confirming the identity of prd-1 by rescuing the mutant circadian phenotype via transformation. PRD-1 is an RNA helicase whose orthologs, DDX5 [DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) Box Helicase 5] and DDX17 in humans and DBP2 (Dead Box Protein 2) in yeast, are implicated in various processes, including transcriptional regulation, elongation, and termination, ribosome biogenesis, and mRNA decay. Although prd-1 mutants display a long period ( approximately 25 h) circadian developmental cycle, they interestingly display a WT period when the core circadian oscillator is tracked using a frq-luciferase transcriptional fusion under conditions of limiting nutritional carbon; the core oscillator in the prd-1 mutant strain runs with a long period under glucose-sufficient conditions. Thus, PRD-1 clearly impacts the circadian oscillator and is not only part of a metabolic oscillator ancillary to the core clock. PRD-1 is an essential protein, and its expression is neither light-regulated nor clock-regulated. However, it is transiently induced by glucose; in the presence of sufficient glucose, PRD-1 is in the nucleus until glucose runs out, which elicits its disappearance from the nucleus. Because circadian period length is carbon concentration-dependent, prd-1 may be formally viewed as a clock mutant with defective nutritional compensation of circadian period length.","['DDX5', 'Dbp2p', 'FRQ', 'RNA helicase', 'circadian']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,NH 03755,2015 Dec 22

However, mechanistic insight into PAN2 and its complex with the asymmetric PAN3 dimer is lacking. Here, we describe crystal structures that show that Neurospora crassa PAN2 comprises two independent structural units: a C-terminal catalytic unit and an N-terminal assembly unit that engages in a bipartite interaction with PAN3 dimers. The catalytic unit contains the exonuclease domain in an intimate complex with a potentially modulatory ubiquitin-protease-like domain. The assembly unit contains a WD40 propeller connected to an adaptable linker. The propeller contacts the PAN3 C-terminal domain, whereas the linker reinforces the asymmetry of the PAN3 dimer and prevents the recruitment of a second PAN2 molecule.

The primary goal of this study was to establish an optimal range of Ag concentration and its state of agglomeration in bioactive nanocomposite TiCaPCON films which would provide a strong bactericidal effect without compromising the material biocompatibility and bioactivity. To obtain samples with different Ag content and redistribution, two different methods were employed: (i) TiCaPCON films deposition by magnetron sputtering of composite Ticapital ES, Cyrillic0.5-Ca3(capital ER, Cyrilliccapital O, Cyrillic4)2 target followed by Ag(+) ion implantation and (ii) Ag-doped TiCaPCON films obtained by co-sputtering of composite Ticapital ES, Cyrillic0.5-Ca3(capital ER, Cyrilliccapital O, Cyrillic4)2 and Ag targets. In order to reveal the antibacterial role of Ag nanoparticles and Ag(+) ions, both separate and in synergy, part of the samples from the first and second groups was subjected to additional ion etching to remove an Ag rich surface layer heavily populated with Ag nanoparticles. All resultant films were characterized with respect to surface morphology, chemical composition, surface roughness, wettability, and Ag(+) ion release. The antibacterial and antifungal effects of the Ag-doped TiCaPCON films were evaluated against clinically isolated Escherichia coli O78 (E. coli) and Neurospora crassa wt-987 spores. The influence of the surface chemistry on spreading, proliferation, and early stages of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cell differentiation was also studied. Our data demonstrated that under optimal conditions in terms of Ag content and agglomeration, the Ag-doped TiCaPCON films are highly efficient against E. coli bacteria and, at the same time, provide good adhesion, spreading, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells which reflect high level of biocompatibility and bioactivity of the films.

33526697,Genome-wide role of codon usage on transcription and identification of potential regulators.,"Codon usage bias is a fundamental feature of all genomes and plays an important role in determining gene expression levels. The codon usage was thought to influence gene expression mainly due to its impact on translation. Recently, however, codon usage was shown to affect transcription of fungal and mammalian genes, indicating the existence of a gene regulatory phenomenon with unknown mechanism. In Neurospora, codon usage biases strongly correlate with mRNA levels genome-wide, and here we show that the correlation between codon usage and RNA levels is maintained in the nucleus. In addition, codon optimality is tightly correlated with both total and nuclear RNA levels, suggesting that codon usage broadly influences mRNA levels through transcription in a translation-independent manner. A large-scale RNA sequencing-based genetic screen in Neurospora identified 18 candidate factors that when deleted decreased the genome-wide correlation between codon usage and RNA levels and reduced the codon usage effect on gene expression. Most of these factors, such as the H3K36 methyltransferase, are chromatin regulators or transcription factors. Together, our results suggest that the transcriptional effect of codon usage is mediated by multiple transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.","['H3K36 methyltransferase', 'Neurospora', 'codon usage', 'transcription', 'translation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,TX 75390,2021 Feb 9
32408045,Production of plant-derived anticancer precursor glucoraphanin in chromosomally engineered Escherichia coli.,"Glucoraphanin is a methionine-derived glucosinolate that imparts numerous health-benefits with broad bioactivity. Low amounts in plant tissues and high cost of extraction have limited the production of glucoraphanin. Metabolic engineering in heterologous microorganisms is an attractive approach to achieve efficient production of valuable natural products. In this study, a microbial fermentation process for glucoraphanin production was demonstrated. The engineered bacterial strain stably expressed 10 allogeneic enzymes in E. coli chromosome, including nine heterologous genes from Arabidopsis and Brassica and one from fungus Neurospora crassa, which could produce the specialized glucosinolate compound glucoraphanin with a titer of 0.675 mug/L by fermentation from glucose. The cofactor supplements and individual gene overexpression for glucoraphanin production were also investigated. This work highlights the possibility of supplying specialized plant glucosinolates by microbial fermentation process, instead of chemical extraction. Additionally, the limiting step enzyme, UDP-glucose-thiohydroximate glucosyltransferase, identified in this study also laid a foundation for further optimizing the glucoraphanin-producing cell factory.","['Cell factory', 'Escherichia coli', 'Glucoraphanin', 'Synthetic biology']",Microbiological research,PR China,2020 Sep
27538689,The introduction of the fungal D-galacturonate pathway enables the consumption of D-galacturonic acid by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"BACKGROUND: Pectin-rich wastes, such as citrus pulp and sugar beet pulp, are produced in considerable amounts by the juice and sugar industry and could be used as raw materials for biorefineries. One possible process in such biorefineries is the hydrolysis of these wastes and the subsequent production of ethanol. However, the ethanol-producing organism of choice, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not able to catabolize D-galacturonic acid, which represents a considerable amount of the sugars in the hydrolysate, namely, 18 % (w/w) from citrus pulp and 16 % (w/w) sugar beet pulp. RESULTS: In the current work, we describe the construction of a strain of S. cerevisiae in which the five genes of the fungal reductive pathway for D-galacturonic acid catabolism were integrated into the yeast chromosomes: gaaA, gaaC and gaaD from Aspergillus niger and lgd1 from Trichoderma reesei, and the recently described D-galacturonic acid transporter protein, gat1, from Neurospora crassa. This strain metabolized D-galacturonic acid in a medium containing D-fructose as co-substrate. CONCLUSION: This work is the first demonstration of the expression of a functional heterologous pathway for D-galacturonic acid catabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is a preliminary step for engineering a yeast strain for the fermentation of pectin-rich substrates to ethanol.","['Citrus pulp', 'D-galacturonic acid', 'Ethanol', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae']",Microbial cell factories,Brazil. ext-alessandra.biz@vtt.fi,2016 Aug 18
25002474,DEAD-box protein CYT-19 is activated by exposed helices in a group I intron RNA.,"DEAD-box proteins are nonprocessive RNA helicases and can function as RNA chaperones, but the mechanisms of their chaperone activity remain incompletely understood. The Neurospora crassa DEAD-box protein CYT-19 is a mitochondrial RNA chaperone that promotes group I intron splicing and has been shown to resolve misfolded group I intron structures, allowing them to refold. Building on previous results, here we use a series of tertiary contact mutants of the Tetrahymena group I intron ribozyme to demonstrate that the efficiency of CYT-19-mediated unfolding of the ribozyme is tightly linked to global RNA tertiary stability. Efficient unfolding of destabilized ribozyme variants is accompanied by increased ATPase activity of CYT-19, suggesting that destabilized ribozymes provide more productive interaction opportunities. The strongest ATPase stimulation occurs with a ribozyme that lacks all five tertiary contacts and does not form a compact structure, and small-angle X-ray scattering indicates that ATPase activity tracks with ribozyme compactness. Further, deletion of three helices that are prominently exposed in the folded structure decreases the ATPase stimulation by the folded ribozyme. Together, these results lead to a model in which CYT-19, and likely related DEAD-box proteins, rearranges complex RNA structures by preferentially interacting with and unwinding exposed RNA secondary structure. Importantly, this mechanism could bias DEAD-box proteins to act on misfolded RNAs and ribonucleoproteins, which are likely to be less compact and more dynamic than their native counterparts.","['RNA folding', 'RNA misfolding', 'RNA tertiary structure', 'RNA unwinding', 'superfamily 2 helicase']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,TX 78712; and,2014 Jul 22
24762679,Proper actin ring formation and septum constriction requires coordinated regulation of SIN and MOR pathways through the germinal centre kinase MST-1.,"Nuclear DBF2p-related (NDR) kinases constitute a functionally conserved protein family of eukaryotic regulators that control cell division and polarity. In fungi, they function as effector kinases of the morphogenesis (MOR) and septation initiation (SIN) networks and are activated by pathway-specific germinal centre (GC) kinases. We characterized a third GC kinase, MST-1, that connects both kinase cascades. Genetic and biochemical interactions with SIN components and life cell imaging identify MST-1 as SIN-associated kinase that functions in parallel with the GC kinase SID-1 to activate the SIN-effector kinase DBF-2. SID-1 and MST-1 are both regulated by the upstream SIN kinase CDC-7, yet in an opposite manner. Aberrant cortical actomyosin rings are formed in Deltamst-1, which resulted in mis-positioned septa and irregular spirals, indicating that MST-1-dependent regulation of the SIN is required for proper formation and constriction of the septal actomyosin ring. However, MST-1 also interacts with several components of the MOR network and modulates MOR activity at multiple levels. MST-1 functions as promiscuous enzyme and also activates the MOR effector kinase COT-1 through hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. In addition, MST-1 physically interacts with the MOR kinase POD-6, and dimerization of both proteins inactivates the GC kinase hetero-complex. These data specify an antagonistic relationship between the SIN and MOR during septum formation in the filamentous ascomycete model Neurospora crassa that is, at least in part, coordinated through the GC kinase MST-1. The similarity of the SIN and MOR pathways to the animal Hippo and Ndr pathways, respectively, suggests that intensive cross-communication between distinct NDR kinase modules may also be relevant for the homologous NDR kinases of higher eukaryotes.",?,PLoS genetics,Germany,2014 Apr

We have determined the structure of the TOM core complex by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). The complex is a 148 kDa symmetrical dimer of ten membrane protein subunits that create a shallow funnel on the cytoplasmic membrane surface. In the core of the dimer, the beta-barrels of the Tom40 pore form two identical preprotein conduits. Each Tom40 pore is surrounded by the transmembrane segments of the alpha-helical subunits Tom5, Tom6, and Tom7.

26429971,Molecular basis for the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of thymine-7-hydroxylase in fungi.,"TET proteins play a vital role in active DNA demethylation in mammals and thus have important functions in many essential cellular processes. The chemistry for the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC catalysed by TET proteins is similar to that of T to 5hmU, 5fU and 5caU catalysed by thymine-7-hydroxylase (T7H) in the nucleotide anabolism in fungi. Here, we report the crystal structures and biochemical properties of Neurospora crassa T7H. T7H can bind the substrates only in the presence of cosubstrate, and binding of different substrates does not induce notable conformational changes. T7H exhibits comparable binding affinity for T and 5hmU, but 3-fold lower affinity for 5fU. Residues Phe292, Tyr217 and Arg190 play critical roles in substrate binding and catalysis, and the interactions of the C5 modification group of substrates with the cosubstrate and enzyme contribute to the slightly varied binding affinity and activity towards different substrates. After the catalysis, the products are released and new cosubstrate and substrate are reloaded to conduct the next oxidation reaction. Our data reveal the molecular basis for substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of T7H and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition and catalysis of TET proteins.",?,Nucleic acids research,China,2015 Nov 16
28704372,The ancestral levels of transcription and the evolution of sexual phenotypes in filamentous fungi.,"Changes in gene expression have been hypothesized to play an important role in the evolution of divergent morphologies. To test this hypothesis in a model system, we examined differences in fruiting body morphology of five filamentous fungi in the Sordariomycetes, culturing them in a common garden environment and profiling genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages. We reconstructed ancestral gene expression phenotypes, identifying genes with the largest evolved increases in gene expression across development. Conducting knockouts and performing phenotypic analysis in two divergent species typically demonstrated altered fruiting body development in the species that had evolved increased expression. Our evolutionary approach to finding relevant genes proved far more efficient than other gene deletion studies targeting whole genomes or gene families. Combining gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes facilitated the refinement of Bayesian networks of the genes underlying fruiting body development, regulation of which is one of the least understood processes of multicellular development.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2017 Jul
23453622,Genetic basis of cell-cell fusion mechanisms.,"Cell-cell fusion in sexually reproducing organisms is a mechanism to merge gamete genomes and, in multicellular organisms, it is a strategy to sculpt organs, such as muscle, bone, and placenta. Moreover, this mechanism has been implicated in pathological conditions, such as infection and cancer. Studies of genetic model organisms have uncovered a unifying principle: cell fusion is a genetically programmed process. This process can be divided in three stages: competence (cell induction and differentiation); commitment (cell determination, migration, and adhesion); and cell fusion (membrane merging and cytoplasmic mixing). Recent work has led to the discovery of fusogens, which are cell fusion proteins that are necessary and sufficient to fuse cell membranes. Two unrelated families of fusogens have been discovered, one in mouse placenta and one in Caenorhabditis elegans (syncytins and F proteins, respectively). Current research aims to identify new fusogens and determine the mechanisms by which they merge membranes.",?,Trends in genetics : TIG,Uruguay,2013 Jul
32527036,Polycomb Repression without Bristles: Facultative Heterochromatin and Genome Stability in Fungi.,"Genome integrity is essential to maintain cellular function and viability. Consequently, genome instability is frequently associated with dysfunction in cells and associated with plant, animal, and human diseases. One consequence of relaxed genome maintenance that may be less appreciated is an increased potential for rapid adaptation to changing environments in all organisms. Here, we discuss evidence for the control and function of facultative heterochromatin, which is delineated by methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me) in many fungi. Aside from its relatively well understood role in transcriptional repression, accumulating evidence suggests that H3K27 methylation has an important role in controlling the balance between maintenance and generation of novelty in fungal genomes. We present a working model for a minimal repressive network mediated by H3K27 methylation in fungi and outline challenges for future research.","['Cryptococcus', 'Fusarium', 'Neurospora', 'PRC2', 'Zymoseptoria', 'fungi', 'histones', 'lysine methylation', 'polycomb repressive complex']",Genes,USA,2020 Jun 9
28459455,DNA sequence homology induces cytosine-to-thymine mutation by a heterochromatin-related pathway in Neurospora.,"Most eukaryotic genomes contain substantial amounts of repetitive DNA organized in the form of constitutive heterochromatin and associated with repressive epigenetic modifications, such as H3K9me3 and C5 cytosine methylation (5mC). In the fungus Neurospora crassa, H3K9me3 and 5mC are catalyzed, respectively, by a conserved SUV39 histone methyltransferase, DIM-5, and a DNMT1-like cytosine methyltransferase, DIM-2. Here we show that DIM-2 can also mediate repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) of repetitive DNA in N. crassa. We further show that DIM-2-dependent RIP requires DIM-5, HP1, and other known heterochromatin factors, implying a role for a repeat-induced heterochromatin-related process. Our previous findings suggest that the mechanism of repeat recognition for RIP involves direct interactions between homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) segments. We thus now propose that, in somatic cells, homologous dsDNA-dsDNA interactions between a small number of repeat copies can nucleate a transient heterochromatic state, which, on longer repeat arrays, may lead to the formation of constitutive heterochromatin.",?,Nature genetics,USA,2017 Jun
24140149,Polygalacturonases from Moniliophthora perniciosa are regulated by fermentable carbon sources and possible post-translational modifications.,"We report the first molecular and in silico analysis of Monilophthora perniciosa polygalacturonases (PGs). Three MpPG genes (MpPG1, MpPG2 and MpPG3) were identified and analyzed at transcriptional level, by RT-qPCR, in dikaryotic M. perniciosa mycelium grown on solid-bran based medium and on liquid medium supplemented with different fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources. The MpPG genes presented different expression patterns suggesting different individual regulation. However, all are mainly regulated by fermentable carbon sources (galactose and mannose). The integrated analysis of PG gene expression and systems biology (using MpG1 and MpG2 orthologs in Neurospora crassa, named NCU06961 and NCU02369, respectively) allowed identifying some possible mechanism of protein regulation during the necrotrophic fungal phase. MpPG1-NCU06961 and MpPG2-NCU02369 directly or indirectly interacted with central and highly connected proteins involved in protein synthesis and protein regulation associated to post-translational modifications, in cell wall metabolism, and in cellular metabolism related to energy production.

33176131,Role of Protein in Fungal Biomineralization of Copper Carbonate Nanoparticles.,"Biomineralization processes are of key importance in the biogeochemical cycling of metals and other elements by microorganisms, and several studies have highlighted the potential applications of nanoparticle synthesis via biomineralization. The roles played by proteins in the transformation and biologically induced biomineralization of metals by microorganisms is not well understood, despite the interactions of protein and nanoparticles at mineral interfaces attracting much interest in various emerging fields for novel biomaterial synthesis. Here, we have elucidated the association and involvement of fungal proteins in the formation of biogenic copper carbonate nanoparticles (CuNPs) using a carbonate-enriched biomass-free ureolytic fungal culture supernatant. Proteomic analysis was conducted that identified the major proteins present in the culture supernatant. Of the proteins identified, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) exhibited a strong affinity to the CuNPs, and the impact of purified TPI on CuNP formation was studied in detail. The combined use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed that TPI played an important role in controlling the morphology and structure of the nanomaterials. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to examine conformational changes of the proteins to further clarity the interaction mechanisms with CuNPs during biomineralization. Such analyses revealed unfolding of proteins on the mineral surface and an increase in beta sheets within the protein structure. These results extend understanding of how microbial systems can influence biomineral formation through protein secretion, the mechanisms involved in formation of complex protein/inorganic systems, and provide useful guidelines for the synthesis of inorganic-protein based nanomaterials.","['biomineralization', 'copper', 'fungi', 'geomicrobiology', 'geomycology', 'nanoparticles', 'protein', 'proteomics']",Current biology : CB,UK,2021 Jan 25
31822585,"Integrative Activity of Mating Loci, Environmentally Responsive Genes, and Secondary Metabolism Pathways during Sexual Development of Chaetomium globosum.","The origins and maintenance of the rich fungal diversity have been longstanding issues in evolutionary biology. To investigate how differences in expression regulation contribute to divergences in development and ecology among closely related species, transcriptomes were compared between Chaetomium globosum, a homothallic pathogenic fungus thriving in highly humid ecologies, and Neurospora crassa, a heterothallic postfire saprotroph. Gene expression was quantified in perithecia at nine distinct morphological stages during nearly synchronous sexual development. Unlike N. crassa, expression of all mating loci in C. globosum was highly correlated. Key regulators of the initiation of sexual development in response to light stimuli-including orthologs of N. crassasub-1, sub-1-dependent gene NCU00309, and asl-1-showed regulatory dynamics matching between C. globosum and N. crassa Among 24 secondary metabolism gene clusters in C. globosum, 11-including the cochliodones biosynthesis cluster-exhibited highly coordinated expression across perithecial development. C. globosum exhibited coordinately upregulated expression of histidine kinases in hyperosmotic response pathways-consistent with gene expression responses to high humidity we identified in fellow pathogen Fusarium graminearum Bayesian networks indicated that gene interactions during sexual development have diverged in concert with the capacities both to reproduce asexually and to live a self-compatible versus self-incompatible life cycle, shifting the hierarchical roles of genes associated with conidiation and heterokaryon incompatibility in N. crassa and C. globosum This divergence supports an evolutionary history of loss of conidiation due to unfavorable combinations of heterokaryon incompatibility in homothallic species.IMPORTANCE Fungal diversity has amazed evolutionary biologists for decades. One societally important aspect of this diversity manifests in traits that enable pathogenicity. The opportunistic pathogen Chaetomium globosum is well adapted to a high-humidity environment and produces numerous secondary metabolites that defend it from predation. Many of these chemicals can threaten human health. Understanding the phases of the C. globosum life cycle in which these products are made enables better control and even utilization of this fungus. Among its intriguing traits is that it both is self-fertile and lacks any means of propagule-based asexual reproduction. By profiling genome-wide gene expression across the process of sexual reproduction in C. globosum and comparing it to genome-wide gene expression in the model filamentous fungus N. crassa and other closely related fungi, we revealed associations among mating-type genes, sexual developmental genes, sexual incompatibility regulators, environmentally responsive genes, and secondary metabolic pathways.","['Bayesian network', 'environmental response', 'fungal pathogen', 'homothallism', 'secondary metabolism', 'sexual development', 'transcriptomics']",mBio,USA,2019 Dec 10
28320951,Recurrent rewiring and emergence of RNA regulatory networks.,"Alterations in regulatory networks contribute to evolutionary change. Transcriptional networks are reconfigured by changes in the binding specificity of transcription factors and their cognate sites. The evolution of RNA-protein regulatory networks is far less understood. The PUF (Pumilio and FBF) family of RNA regulatory proteins controls the translation, stability, and movements of hundreds of mRNAs in a single species. We probe the evolution of PUF-RNA networks by direct identification of the mRNAs bound to PUF proteins in budding and filamentous fungi and by computational analyses of orthologous RNAs from 62 fungal species. Our findings reveal that PUF proteins gain and lose mRNAs with related and emergent biological functions during evolution. We demonstrate at least two independent rewiring events for PUF3 orthologs, independent but convergent evolution of PUF4/5 binding specificity and the rewiring of the PUF4/5 regulons in different fungal lineages.

27260477,Neurospora chromosomes are organized by blocks of importin alpha-dependent heterochromatin that are largely independent of H3K9me3.,"Eukaryotic genomes are organized into chromatin domains with three-dimensional arrangements that presumably result from interactions between the chromatin constituents-proteins, DNA, and RNA-within the physical constraints of the nucleus. We used chromosome conformation capture (3C) followed by high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C) with wild-type and mutant strains of Neurospora crassa to gain insight into the role of heterochromatin in the organization and function of the genome. We tested the role of three proteins thought to be important for establishment of heterochromatin, namely, the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase DIM-5, Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), which specifically binds to the product of DIM-5 (trimethylated H3 lysine 9 [H3K9me3]), and DIM-3 (importin alpha), which is involved in DIM-5 localization. The average genome configuration of the wild-type strain revealed strong intra- and inter-chromosomal associations between both constitutive and facultative heterochromatic domains, with the strongest interactions among the centromeres, subtelomeres, and interspersed heterochromatin. Surprisingly, loss of either H3K9me3 or HP1 had only mild effects on heterochromatin compaction, whereas dim-3 caused more drastic changes, specifically decreasing interactions between constitutive heterochromatic domains. Thus, associations between heterochromatic regions are a major component of the chromosome conformation in Neurospora, but two widely studied key heterochromatin proteins are not necessary, implying that undefined protein factors play key roles in maintaining overall chromosome organization.",?,Genome research,USA,2016 Aug
32033404,Structural Dynamics of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase during Catalysis.,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are industrially important oxidoreductases employed in lignocellulose saccharification. Using advanced time-resolved mass spectrometric techniques, we elucidated the structural determinants for substrate-mediated stabilization of the fungal LPMO9C from Neurosporacrassa during catalysis. LPMOs require a reduction in the active-site copper for catalytic activity. We show that copper reduction in NcLPMO9C leads to structural rearrangements and compaction around the active site. However, longer exposure to the reducing agent ascorbic acid also initiated an uncoupling reaction of the bound oxygen species, leading to oxidative damage, partial unfolding, and even fragmentation of NcLPMO9C. Interestingly, no changes in the hydrogen/deuterium exchange rate were detected upon incubation of oxidized or reduced LPMO with crystalline cellulose, indicating that the LPMO-substrate interactions are mainly side-chain mediated and neither affect intraprotein hydrogen bonding nor induce significant shielding of the protein surface. On the other hand, we observed a protective effect of the substrate, which slowed down the autooxidative damage induced by the uncoupling reaction. These observations further complement the picture of structural changes during LPMO catalysis.","['hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry', 'lignocellulose degradation', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'oxidative amino acid modification', 'peptide bond cleavage', 'reactive oxygen species']",Biomolecules,Czech Republic,2020 Feb 5
32651262,Normal Patterns of Histone H3K27 Methylation Require the Histone Variant H2A.Z in Neurospora crassa.,"Neurospora crassa contains a minimal Polycomb repression system, which provides rich opportunities to explore Polycomb-mediated repression across eukaryotes and enables genetic studies that can be difficult in plant and animal systems. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 is a multi-subunit complex that deposits mono-, di-, and trimethyl groups on lysine 27 of histone H3, and trimethyl H3K27 is a molecular marker of transcriptionally repressed facultative heterochromatin. In mouse embryonic stem cells and multiple plant species, H2A.Z has been found to be colocalized with H3K27 methylation. H2A.Z is required for normal H3K27 methylation in these experimental systems, though the regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. We report here that Neurospora crassa mutants lacking H2A.Z or SWR-1, the ATP-dependent histone variant exchanger, exhibit a striking reduction in levels of H3K27 methylation. RNA-sequencing revealed downregulation of eed, encoding a subunit of PRC2, in an hH2Az mutant compared to wild type, and overexpression of EED in a DeltahH2Az;Deltaeed background restored most H3K27 methylation. Reduced eed expression leads to region-specific losses of H3K27 methylation, suggesting that differential dependence on EED concentration is critical for normal H3K27 methylation at certain regions in the genome.","['EED', 'H2A.Z', 'H3K27 methylation', 'PRC2']",Genetics,Georgia 30602,2020 Sep
26306046,Tubulin tail sequences and post-translational modifications regulate closure of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC).,"It was previously shown that tubulin dimer interaction with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) blocks traffic through the channel and reduces oxidative metabolism and that this requires the unstructured anionic C-terminal tail peptides found on both alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits. It was unclear whether the alpha- and beta-tubulin tails contribute equally to VDAC blockade and what effects might be due to sequence variations in these tail peptides or to tubulin post-translational modifications, which mostly occur on the tails. The nature of the contribution of the tubulin body beyond acting as an anchor for the tails had not been clarified either. Here we present peptide-protein chimeras to address these questions. These constructs allow us to easily combine a tail peptide with different proteins or combine different tail peptides with a particular protein. The results show that a single tail grafted to an inert protein is sufficient to produce channel closure similar to that observed with tubulin. We show that the beta-tail is more than an order of magnitude more potent than the alpha-tail and that the lower alpha-tail activity is largely due to the presence of a terminal tyrosine. Detyrosination activates the alpha-tail, and activation is reversed by the removal of the glutamic acid penultimate to the tyrosine. Nitration of tyrosine reverses the tyrosine inhibition of binding and even induces prolonged VDAC closures. Our results demonstrate that small changes in sequence or post-translational modification of the unstructured tails of tubulin result in substantial changes in VDAC closure.","['C-terminal domain (carboxyl tail domain, CTD)', 'C-terminal tails', 'electrophysiology', 'intrinsically disordered protein', 'mitochondria', 'mitochondrial regulation', 'protein tails', 'protein-protein interaction']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Maryland 20892 ksheldo@emory.edu,2015 Oct 30
29026070,Single-molecule study of oxidative enzymatic deconstruction of cellulose.,"LPMO (lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase) represents a unique paradigm of cellulosic biomass degradation by an oxidative mechanism. Understanding the role of LPMO in deconstructing crystalline cellulose is fundamental to the enzyme's biological function and will help to specify the use of LPMO in biorefinery applications. Here we show with real-time atomic force microscopy that C1 and C4 oxidizing types of LPMO from Neurospora crassa (NcLPMO9F, NcLPMO9C) bind to nanocrystalline cellulose with high preference for the very same substrate surfaces that are also used by a processive cellulase (Trichoderma reesei CBH I) to move along during hydrolytic cellulose degradation. The bound LPMOs, however, are immobile during their adsorbed residence time ( ~ 1.0 min for NcLPMO9F) on cellulose. Treatment with LPMO resulted in fibrillation of crystalline cellulose and strongly ( >/= 2-fold) enhanced the cellulase adsorption. It also increased enzyme turnover on the cellulose surface, thus boosting the hydrolytic conversion.Understanding the role of enzymes in biomass depolymerization is essential for the development of more efficient biorefineries.

25536042,Evolution of RNA-protein interactions: non-specific binding led to RNA splicing activity of fungal mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases.,"The Neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (mtTyrRS; CYT-18 protein) evolved a new function as a group I intron splicing factor by acquiring the ability to bind group I intron RNAs and stabilize their catalytically active RNA structure. Previous studies showed: (i) CYT-18 binds group I introns by using both its N-terminal catalytic domain and flexibly attached C-terminal anticodon-binding domain (CTD); and (ii) the catalytic domain binds group I introns specifically via multiple structural adaptations that occurred during or after the divergence of Peziomycotina and Saccharomycotina. However, the function of the CTD and how it contributed to the evolution of splicing activity have been unclear. Here, small angle X-ray scattering analysis of CYT-18 shows that both CTDs of the homodimeric protein extend outward from the catalytic domain, but move inward to bind opposite ends of a group I intron RNA. Biochemical assays show that the isolated CTD of CYT-18 binds RNAs non-specifically, possibly contributing to its interaction with the structurally different ends of the intron RNA. Finally, we find that the yeast mtTyrRS, which diverged from Pezizomycotina fungal mtTyrRSs prior to the evolution of splicing activity, binds group I intron and other RNAs non-specifically via its CTD, but lacks further adaptations needed for group I intron splicing. Our results suggest a scenario of constructive neutral (i.e., pre-adaptive) evolution in which an initial non-specific interaction between the CTD of an ancestral fungal mtTyrRS and a self-splicing group I intron was ""fixed"" by an intron RNA mutation that resulted in protein-dependent splicing. Once fixed, this interaction could be elaborated by further adaptive mutations in both the catalytic domain and CTD that enabled specific binding of group I introns. Our results highlight a role for non-specific RNA binding in the evolution of RNA-binding proteins.",?,PLoS biology,United States of America,2014 Dec
32479508,Adaptation of codon usage to tRNA I34 modification controls translation kinetics and proteome landscape.,"Codon usage bias is a universal feature of all genomes and plays an important role in regulating protein expression levels. Modification of adenosine to inosine at the tRNA anticodon wobble position (I34) by adenosine deaminases (ADATs) is observed in all eukaryotes and has been proposed to explain the correlation between codon usage and tRNA pool. However, how the tRNA pool is affected by I34 modification to influence codon usage-dependent gene expression is unclear. Using Neurospora crassa as a model system, by combining molecular, biochemical and bioinformatics analyses, we show that silencing of adat2 expression severely impaired the I34 modification levels for the ADAT-related tRNAs, resulting in major ADAT-related tRNA profile changes and reprogramming of translation elongation kinetics on ADAT-related codons. adat2 silencing also caused genome-wide codon usage-biased ribosome pausing on mRNAs and proteome landscape changes, leading to selective translational repression or induction of different mRNAs. The induced expression of CPC-1, the Neurospora ortholog of yeast GCN4p, mediates the transcriptional response after adat2 silencing and amino acid starvation. Together, our results demonstrate that the tRNA I34 modification by ADAT plays a major role in driving codon usage-biased translation to shape proteome landscape.",?,PLoS genetics,China,2020 Jun
29852014,TPP riboswitch-dependent regulation of an ancient thiamin transporter in Candida.,"Riboswitches are non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to specific ligands. They are primarily found in bacteria. However, one riboswitch type, the thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch, has also been described in some plants, marine protists and fungi. We find that riboswitches are widespread in the budding yeasts (Saccharomycotina), and they are most common in homologs of DUR31, originally described as a spermidine transporter. We show that DUR31 (an ortholog of N. crassa gene NCU01977) encodes a thiamin transporter in Candida species. Using an RFP/riboswitch expression system, we show that the functional elements of the riboswitch are contained within the native intron of DUR31 from Candida parapsilosis, and that the riboswitch regulates splicing in a thiamin-dependent manner when RFP is constitutively expressed. The DUR31 gene has been lost from Saccharomyces, and may have been displaced by an alternative thiamin transporter. TPP riboswitches are also present in other putative transporters in yeasts and filamentous fungi.

25793375,Neurospora importin alpha is required for normal heterochromatic formation and DNA methylation.,"Heterochromatin and associated gene silencing processes play roles in development, genome defense, and chromosome function. In many species, constitutive heterochromatin is decorated with histone H3 tri-methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and cytosine methylation. In Neurospora crassa, a five-protein complex, DCDC, catalyzes H3K9 methylation, which then directs DNA methylation. Here, we identify and characterize a gene important for DCDC function, dim-3 (defective in methylation-3), which encodes the nuclear import chaperone NUP-6 (Importin alpha). The critical mutation in dim-3 results in a substitution in an ARM repeat of NUP-6 and causes a substantial loss of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. Surprisingly, nuclear transport of all known proteins involved in histone and DNA methylation, as well as a canonical transport substrate, appear normal in dim-3 strains. Interactions between DCDC members also appear normal, but the nup-6(dim-3) allele causes the DCDC members DIM-5 and DIM-7 to mislocalize from heterochromatin and NUP-6dim-3 itself is mislocalized from the nuclear envelope, at least in conidia. GCN-5, a member of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex, also shows altered localization in dim-3, raising the possibility that NUP-6 is necessary to localize multiple chromatin complexes following nucleocytoplasmic transport.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2015 Mar
25841015,Functional Analysis of Two l-Arabinose Transporters from Filamentous Fungi Reveals Promising Characteristics for Improved Pentose Utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Limited uptake is one of the bottlenecks for l-arabinose fermentation from lignocellulosic hydrolysates in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study characterized two novel l-arabinose transporters, LAT-1 from Neurospora crassa and MtLAT-1 from Myceliophthora thermophila. Although the two proteins share high identity (about 83%), they display different substrate specificities. Sugar transport assays using the S. cerevisiae strain EBY.VW4000 indicated that LAT-1 accepts a broad substrate spectrum. In contrast, MtLAT-1 appeared much more specific for l-arabinose. Determination of the kinetic properties of both transporters revealed that the Km values of LAT-1 and MtLAT-1 for l-arabinose were 58.12 +/- 4.06 mM and 29.39 +/- 3.60 mM, respectively, with corresponding Vmax values of 116.7 +/- 3.0 mmol/h/g dry cell weight (DCW) and 10.29 +/- 0.35 mmol/h/g DCW, respectively. In addition, both transporters were found to use a proton-coupled symport mechanism and showed only partial inhibition by d-glucose during l-arabinose uptake. Moreover, LAT-1 and MtLAT-1 were expressed in the S. cerevisiae strain BSW2AP containing an l-arabinose metabolic pathway. Both recombinant strains exhibited much faster l-arabinose utilization, greater biomass accumulation, and higher ethanol production than the control strain. In conclusion, because of higher maximum velocities and reduced inhibition by d-glucose, the genes for the two characterized transporters are promising targets for improved l-arabinose utilization and fermentation in S. cerevisiae.",?,Applied and environmental microbiology,China,2015 Jun 15
23828427,The amino acids surrounding the flavin 7a-methyl group determine the UVA spectral features of a LOV protein.,"Flavin-binding light, oxygen, and voltage (LOV) domains are UVA/blue-light-sensing protein units that form a reversible flavin mononucleotide-cysteine adduct upon light induction. In their dark-adapted state, LOV domains exhibit the typical spectral features of fully oxidized riboflavin derivatives. A survey on the absorption spectra of various LOV domains revealed that the UVA spectral range is the most variable region (whereas the absorption band at 450 nm is virtually unchanged), showing essentially two distinct patterns found in plant phototropin LOV1 and LOV2 domains, respectively. In this work, we have identified a residue directly interacting with the isoalloxazine methyl group at C(7a) as the major UVA spectral tuner. In YtvA from Bacillus subtilis, this amino acid is threonine 30, and its mutation into apolar residues converts the LOV2-like spectrum of native YtvA into a LOV1-like pattern. Mutation T30A also accelerates the photocycle ca. 4-fold. Together with control mutations at different positions, our results experimentally confirm the previously calculated direction of the transition dipole moment for the UVA pipi* state and identify the mechanisms underlying spectral tuning in the LOV domains.",?,Biological chemistry,,2013 Nov
29587630,Notos - a galaxy tool to analyze CpN observed expected ratios for inferring DNA methylation types.,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation patterns store epigenetic information in the vast majority of eukaryotic species. The relatively high costs and technical challenges associated with the detection of DNA methylation however have created a bias in the number of methylation studies towards model organisms. Consequently, it remains challenging to infer kingdom-wide general rules about the functions and evolutionary conservation of DNA methylation. Methylated cytosine is often found in specific CpN dinucleotides, and the frequency distributions of, for instance, CpG observed/expected (CpG o/e) ratios have been used to infer DNA methylation types based on higher mutability of methylated CpG. RESULTS: Predominantly model-based approaches essentially founded on mixtures of Gaussian distributions are currently used to investigate questions related to the number and position of modes of CpG o/e ratios. These approaches require the selection of an appropriate criterion for determining the best model and will fail if empirical distributions are complex or even merely moderately skewed. We use a kernel density estimation (KDE) based technique for robust and precise characterization of complex CpN o/e distributions without a priori assumptions about the underlying distributions. CONCLUSIONS: We show that KDE delivers robust descriptions of CpN o/e distributions. For straightforward processing, we have developed a Galaxy tool, called Notos and available at the ToolShed, that calculates these ratios of input FASTA files and fits a density to their empirical distribution. Based on the estimated density the number and shape of modes of the distribution is determined, providing a rational for the prediction of the number and the types of different methylation classes. Notos is written in R and Perl.","['CpG o/e ratio', 'CpN o/e ratio', 'DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Kernel density estimation']",BMC bioinformatics,Germany,2018 Mar 27
32329962,Messenger RNA delivery to mitoribosomes - hints from a bacterial toxin.,"In mammalian mitochondria, messenger RNA is processed and matured from large primary transcripts in structures known as RNA granules. The identity of the factors and process transferring the matured mRNA to the mitoribosome for translation is unclear. Nascent mature transcripts are believed to associate initially with the small mitoribosomal subunit prior to recruitment of the large subunit to form the translationally active monosome. When the small subunit fails to assemble, however, the stability of mt-mRNA is only marginally affected, and under these conditions, the LRPPRC/SLIRP RNA-binding complex has been implicated in maintaining mt-mRNA stability. Here, we exploit the activity of a bacterial ribotoxin, VapC20, to show that in the absence of the large mitoribosomal subunit, mt-mRNA species are selectively lost. Further, if the small subunit is also depleted, the mt-mRNA levels are recovered. As a consequence of these data, we suggest a natural pathway for loading processed mt-mRNA onto the mitoribosome.","['LRPPRC/SLIRP', 'SRL', 'VapC20', 'mitochondrial mRNA turnover', 'mitoribosome']",The FEBS journal,UK,2021 Jan
26536259,A Combination of Actin Treadmilling and Cross-Linking Drives Contraction of Random Actomyosin Arrays.,"We investigate computationally the self-organization and contraction of an initially random actomyosin ring. In the framework of a detailed physical model for a ring of cross-linked actin filaments and myosin-II clusters, we derive the force balance equations and solve them numerically. We find that to contract, actin filaments have to treadmill and to be sufficiently cross linked, and myosin has to be processive. The simulations reveal how contraction scales with mechanochemical parameters. For example, they show that the ring made of longer filaments generates greater force but contracts slower. The model predicts that the ring contracts with a constant rate proportional to the initial ring radius if either myosin is released from the ring during contraction and actin filaments shorten, or if myosin is retained in the ring, while the actin filament number decreases. We demonstrate that a balance of actin nucleation and compression-dependent disassembly can also sustain contraction. Finally, the model demonstrates that with time pattern formation takes place in the ring, worsening the contractile process. The more random the actin dynamics are, the higher the contractility will be.",?,Biophysical journal,New York,2015 Nov 3
33056988,Analysis of translating mitoribosome reveals functional characteristics of translation in mitochondria of fungi.,"Mitoribosomes are specialized protein synthesis machineries in mitochondria. However, how mRNA binds to its dedicated channel, and tRNA moves as the mitoribosomal subunit rotate with respect to each other is not understood. We report models of the translating fungal mitoribosome with mRNA, tRNA and nascent polypeptide, as well as an assembly intermediate. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is found in the central protuberance of the large subunit, and the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF(1)) in the small subunit. The models of the active mitoribosome explain how mRNA binds through a dedicated protein platform on the small subunit, tRNA is translocated with the help of the protein mL108, bridging it with L1 stalk on the large subunit, and nascent polypeptide paths through a newly shaped exit tunnel involving a series of structural rearrangements. An assembly intermediate is modeled with the maturation factor Atp25, providing insight into the biogenesis of the mitoribosomal large subunit and translation regulation.",?,Nature communications,Sweden,2020 Oct 14
27036943,Structural Divergence of the Group I Intron Binding Surface in Fungal Mitochondrial Tyrosyl-tRNA Synthetases That Function in RNA Splicing.,"The mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases (mtTyrRSs) of Pezizomycotina fungi, a subphylum that includes many pathogenic species, are bifunctional proteins that both charge mitochondrial tRNA(Tyr) and act as splicing cofactors for autocatalytic group I introns. Previous studies showed that one of these proteins, Neurospora crassa CYT-18, binds group I introns by using both its N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal anticodon binding domains and that the catalytic domain uses a newly evolved group I intron binding surface that includes an N-terminal extension and two small insertions (insertions 1 and 2) with distinctive features not found in non-splicing mtTyrRSs. To explore how this RNA binding surface diverged to accommodate different group I introns in other Pezizomycotina fungi, we determined x-ray crystal structures of C-terminally truncated Aspergillus nidulans and Coccidioides posadasii mtTyrRSs. Comparisons with previous N. crassa CYT-18 structures and a structural model of the Aspergillus fumigatus mtTyrRS showed that the overall topology of the group I intron binding surface is conserved but with variations in key intron binding regions, particularly the Pezizomycotina-specific insertions. These insertions, which arose by expansion of flexible termini or internal loops, show greater variation in structure and amino acids potentially involved in group I intron binding than do neighboring protein core regions, which also function in intron binding but may be more constrained to preserve mtTyrRS activity. Our results suggest a structural basis for the intron specificity of different Pezizomycotina mtTyrRSs, highlight flexible terminal and loop regions as major sites for enzyme diversification, and identify targets for therapeutic intervention by disrupting an essential RNA-protein interaction in pathogenic fungi.","['RNA binding protein', 'aminoacyl tRNA synthetase', 'protein evolution', 'ribozyme', 'x-ray crystallography']",The Journal of biological chemistry,Texas 78712 and,2016 May 27
25037570,Activation of a TRP-like channel and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics during phospholipase-C-mediated cell death.,"The model organism Neurospora crassa undergoes programmed cell death when exposed to staurosporine. Here, we show that staurosporine causes defined changes in cytosolic free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]c) dynamics and a distinct Ca(2+) signature that involves Ca(2+) influx from the external medium and internal Ca(2+) stores. We investigated the molecular basis of this Ca(2+) response by using [Ca(2+)]c measurements combined with pharmacological and genetic approaches. Phospholipase C was identified as a pivotal player during cell death, because modulation of the phospholipase C signaling pathway and deletion of PLC-2, which we show to be involved in hyphal development, results in an inability to trigger the characteristic staurosporine-induced Ca(2+) signature. Using Deltacch-1, Deltafig-1 and Deltayvc-1 mutants and a range of inhibitors, we show that extracellular Ca(2+) entry does not occur through the hitherto described high- and low-affinity Ca(2+) uptake systems, but through the opening of plasma membrane channels with properties resembling the transient receptor potential (TRP) family. Partial blockage of the response to staurosporine after inhibition of a putative inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor suggests that Ca(2+) release from internal stores following IP3 formation combines with the extracellular Ca(2+) influx.","['Cell death', 'Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'Phospholipase C', 'Staurosporine', 'Transient receptor potential channel']",Journal of cell science,Portugal apgoncalves@ibmc.up.pt avideira@ibmc.up.pt,2014 Sep 1
32633757,NC2 complex is a key factor for the activation of catalase-3 transcription by regulating H2A.Z deposition.,"Negative cofactor 2 (NC2), including two subunits NC2alpha and NC2beta, is a conserved positive/negative regulator of class II gene transcription in eukaryotes. It is known that NC2 functions by regulating the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex. However, the exact role of NC2 in transcriptional regulation is still unclear. Here, we reveal that, in Neurospora crassa, NC2 activates catalase-3 (cat-3) gene transcription in the form of heterodimer mediated by histone fold (HF) domains of two subunits. Deletion of HF domain in either of two subunits disrupts the NC2alpha-NC2beta interaction and the binding of intact NC2 heterodimer to cat-3 locus. Loss of NC2 dramatically increases histone variant H2A.Z deposition at cat-3 locus. Further studies show that NC2 recruits chromatin remodeling complex INO80C to remove H2A.Z from the nucleosomes around cat-3 locus, resulting in transcriptional activation of cat-3. Besides HF domains of two subunits, interestingly, C-terminal repression domain of NC2beta is required not only for NC2 binding to cat-3 locus, but also for the recruitment of INO80C to cat-3 locus and removal of H2A.Z from the nucleosomes. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of NC2 in transcription activation through recruiting INO80C to remove H2A.Z from special H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes.",?,Nucleic acids research,China,2020 Sep 4

Herein, soluble polysaccharides (FSRP) were isolated from soybean residue fermented by Neurospora crassa, and FSRP mainly contained rhamnose, arabinose, fucose, mannose, glucose, and galactose, according to GC-MS analysis. To further investigate the protective effect of FSRP against colitis, dextran sulfate sodium induction (DSS)-treated mice were orally gavaged with FSRP (200 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) or inulin (400 mg kg(-1) d(-1), a positive control) for 7 d. The results showed that DSS-treated mice displayed symptoms of body weight loss, atrophy, and histopathological changes of colon, as well as gut barrier damage, which were recovered after FSRP supplementation (similar to inulin). Furthermore, the beneficial effects of FSRP were linked to a decreased inflammatory response and increased protein expression of E-cadherin, claudin-1 and ZO-1. Illumina-MiSeq sequencing analysis revealed that FSRP increased microbial diversity and altered community structure. Specifically, FSRP could modulate the abundance of inflammation-related bacteria (such as Tenericutes, Clostridia, and Bacilli) to ameliorate colitis symptoms. Therefore, FSRP can relieve DSS-induced colitis, which is closely associated with reduced levels of inflammatory factors, improved gut barrier function and gut microbiota homeostasis.",?,Food & function,P.

33468665,IMITATION SWITCH is required for normal chromatin structure and gene repression in PRC2 target domains.,"Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins are part of an epigenetic cell memory system that plays essential roles in multicellular development, stem cell biology, X chromosome inactivation, and cancer. In animals, plants, and many fungi, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) to assemble transcriptionally repressed facultative heterochromatin. PRC2 is structurally and functionally conserved in the model fungus Neurospora crassa, and recent work in this organism has generated insights into PRC2 control and function. To identify components of the facultative heterochromatin pathway, we performed a targeted screen of Neurospora deletion strains lacking individual ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. We found the Neurospora homolog of IMITATION SWITCH (ISW) is critical for normal transcriptional repression, nucleosome organization, and establishment of typical histone methylation patterns in facultative heterochromatin domains. We also found that stable interaction between PRC2 and chromatin depends on ISW. A functional ISW ATPase domain is required for gene repression and normal H3K27 methylation. ISW homologs interact with accessory proteins to form multiple complexes with distinct functions. Using proteomics and molecular approaches, we identified three distinct Neurospora ISW-containing complexes. A triple mutant lacking three ISW accessory factors and disrupting multiple ISW complexes led to widespread up-regulation of PRC2 target genes and altered H3K27 methylation patterns, similar to an ISW-deficient strain. Taken together, our data show that ISW is a key component of the facultative heterochromatin pathway in Neurospora, and that distinct ISW complexes perform an apparently overlapping role to regulate chromatin structure and gene repression at PRC2 target domains.","['H3K27me3', 'IMITATION SWITCH (ISWI)', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)', 'chromatin remodeling', 'facultative heterochromatin']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,GA 30602,2021 Jan 26
34738811,Fast and Specific Peroxygenase Reactions Catalyzed by Fungal Mono-Copper Enzymes.,"The copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are receiving attention because of their role in the degradation of recalcitrant biomass and their intriguing catalytic properties. The fundamentals of LPMO catalysis remain somewhat enigmatic as the LPMO reaction is affected by a multitude of LPMO- and co-substrate-mediated (side) reactions that result in a complex reaction network. We have performed kinetic studies with two LPMOs that are active on soluble substrates, NcAA9C and LsAA9A, using various reductants typically employed for LPMO activation. Studies with NcAA9C under ""monooxygenase"" conditions showed that the impact of the reductant on catalytic activity is correlated with the hydrogen peroxide-generating ability of the LPMO-reductant combination, supporting the idea that a peroxygenase reaction is taking place. Indeed, the apparent monooxygenase reaction could be inhibited by a competing H(2)O(2)-consuming enzyme. Interestingly, these fungal AA9-type LPMOs were found to have higher oxidase activity than bacterial AA10-type LPMOs. Kinetic analysis of the peroxygenase activity of NcAA9C on cellopentaose revealed a fast stoichiometric conversion of high amounts of H(2)O(2) to oxidized carbohydrate products. A k(cat) value of 124 +/- 27 s(-1) at 4  degrees C is 20 times higher than a previously described k(cat) for peroxygenase activity on an insoluble substrate (at 25  degrees C) and some 4 orders of magnitude higher than typical ""monooxygenase"" rates. Similar studies with LsAA9A revealed differences between the two enzymes but confirmed fast and specific peroxygenase activity. These results show that the catalytic site arrangement of LPMOs provides a unique scaffold for highly efficient copper redox catalysis.",?,Biochemistry,Norway,2021 Nov 30
30461263,Previously Uncharacterized Vacuolar-type ATPase Binding Site Discovered from Structurally Similar Compounds with Distinct Mechanisms of Action.,"Using a comprehensive chemical genetics approach, we identified a member of the lignan natural product family, HTP-013, which exhibited significant cytotoxicity across various cancer cell lines. Correlation of compound activity across a panel of reporter gene assays suggested the vacuolar-type ATPase (v-ATPase) as a potential target for this compound. Additional cellular studies and a yeast haploinsufficiency screen strongly supported this finding. Competitive photoaffinity labeling experiments demonstrated that the ATP6V0A2 subunit of the v-ATPase complex binds directly to HTP-013, and further mutagenesis library screening identified resistance-conferring mutations in ATP6V0A2. The positions of these mutations suggest the molecule binds a novel pocket within the domain of the v-ATPase complex responsible for proton translocation. While other mechanisms of v-ATPase regulation have been described, such as dissociation of the complex or inhibition by natural products including bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin, this work provides detailed insight into a distinct binding pocket within the v-ATPase complex.",?,ACS chemical biology,United States,2019 Jan 18
34175309,Interdomain connecting loop and J loop structures determine cross-species compatibility of PCNA.,"Eukaryotic proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays an essential role in orchestrating the assembly of the replisome complex, stimulating processive DNA synthesis, and recruiting other regulatory proteins during the DNA damage response. PCNA and its binding partner network are relatively conserved in eukaryotes, and it exhibits extraordinary structural similarity across species. However, despite this structural similarity, the PCNA of a given species is rarely functional in heterologous systems. In this report, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of Neurospora crassa PCNA (NcPCNA) and compared its structure-function relationship with other available PCNA studies to understand this cross-species incompatibility. We found two regions, the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL) and J loop structures, vary significantly among PCNAs. In particular, the J loop deviates in NcPCNA from that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae PCNA (ScPCNA) by 7 A. Differences in the IDCL structures result in varied binding affinities of PCNAs for the subunit Pol32 of DNA polymerase delta and for T2-amino alcohol, a small-molecule inhibitor of human PCNA. To validate that these structural differences are accountable for functional incompatibility in S. cerevisiae, we generated NcPCNA mutants mimicking IDCL and J loop structures of ScPCNA. Our genetic analyses suggested that NcPCNA mutants are fully functional in S. cerevisiae. The susceptibility of the strains harboring ScPCNA mimics of NcPCNA to various genotoxic agents was similar to that in yeast cells expressing ScPCNA. Taken together, we conclude that in addition to the overall architecture of PCNA, structures of the IDCL and J loop of PCNA are critical determinants of interspecies functional compatibility.","['DNA damage', 'DNA polymerase', 'DNA replication', 'PCNA', 'PIP box motif', 'X-ray crystal structure', 'complementation', 'isothermal titration calorimetry']",The Journal of biological chemistry,India,2021 Jul
25428936,Genomics review of holocellulose deconstruction by aspergilli.,"Biomass is constructed of dense recalcitrant polymeric materials: proteins, lignin, and holocellulose, a fraction constituting fibrous cellulose wrapped in hemicellulose-pectin. Bacteria and fungi are abundant in soil and forest floors, actively recycling biomass mainly by extracting sugars from holocellulose degradation. Here we review the genome-wide contents of seven Aspergillus species and unravel hundreds of gene models encoding holocellulose-degrading enzymes. Numerous apparent gene duplications followed functional evolution, grouping similar genes into smaller coherent functional families according to specialized structural features, domain organization, biochemical activity, and genus genome distribution. Aspergilli contain about 37 cellulase gene models, clustered in two mechanistic categories: 27 hydrolyze and 10 oxidize glycosidic bonds. Within the oxidative enzymes, we found two cellobiose dehydrogenases that produce oxygen radicals utilized by eight lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases that oxidize glycosidic linkages, breaking crystalline cellulose chains and making them accessible to hydrolytic enzymes. Among the hydrolases, six cellobiohydrolases with a tunnel-like structural fold embrace single crystalline cellulose chains and cooperate at nonreducing or reducing end termini, splitting off cellobiose. Five endoglucanases group into four structural families and interact randomly and internally with cellulose through an open cleft catalytic domain, and finally, seven extracellular beta-glucosidases cleave cellobiose and related oligomers into glucose. Aspergilli contain, on average, 30 hemicellulase and 7 accessory gene models, distributed among 9 distinct functional categories: the backbone-attacking enzymes xylanase, mannosidase, arabinase, and xyloglucanase, the short-side-chain-removing enzymes xylan alpha-1,2-glucuronidase, arabinofuranosidase, and xylosidase, and the accessory enzymes acetyl xylan and feruloyl esterases.",?,Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,USA,2014 Dec
30777305,A Cholesterol Analog Induces an Oligomeric Reorganization of VDAC.,"The oligomeric organization of the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) and its interactions with hexokinase play integral roles in mitochondrially mediated apoptotic signaling. Various small to large assemblies of VDAC are observed in mitochondrial outer membranes, but they do not predominate in detergent-solubilized VDAC samples. In this study, a cholesterol analog, cholesteryl-hemisuccinate (CHS), was shown to induce the formation of detergent-soluble VDAC multimers. The various oligomeric states of VDAC induced by the addition of CHS were deciphered through an integrated biophysics approach using microscale thermophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, and size-exclusion chromatography small angle x-ray scattering. Furthermore, CHS stabilizes the interaction between VDAC and hexokinase (K(d) of 27 +/- 6 muM), confirming the biological relevance of oligomers generated. Thus, sterols such as cholesterol in higher eukaryotes or ergosterol in fungi may regulate the VDAC oligomeric state and may provide a potential target for the modulation of apoptotic signaling by effecting VDAC-VDAC and VDAC-hexokinase interactions. In addition, the integrated biophysical approach described provides a powerful platform for the study of membrane protein complexes in solution.",?,Biophysical journal,Canada,2019 Mar 5
27385828,Structure and function of the yeast listerin (Ltn1) conserved N-terminal domain in binding to stalled 60S ribosomal subunits.,"The Ltn1 E3 ligase (listerin in mammals) has emerged as a paradigm for understanding ribosome-associated ubiquitylation. Ltn1 binds to 60S ribosomal subunits to ubiquitylate nascent polypeptides that become stalled during synthesis; among Ltn1's substrates are aberrant products of mRNA lacking stop codons [nonstop translation products (NSPs)]. Here, we report the reconstitution of NSP ubiquitylation in Neurospora crassa cell extracts. Upon translation in vitro, ribosome-stalled NSPs were ubiquitylated in an Ltn1-dependent manner, while still ribosome-associated. Furthermore, we provide biochemical evidence that the conserved N-terminal domain (NTD) plays a significant role in the binding of Ltn1 to 60S ribosomal subunits and that NTD mutations causing defective 60S binding also lead to defective NSP ubiquitylation, without affecting Ltn1's intrinsic E3 ligase activity. Finally, we report the crystal structure of the Ltn1 NTD at 2.4-A resolution. The structure, combined with additional mutational studies, provides insight to NTD's role in binding stalled 60S subunits. Our findings show that Neurospora extracts can be used as a tool to dissect mechanisms underlying ribosome-associated protein quality control and are consistent with a model in which Ltn1 uses 60S subunits as adapters, at least in part via its NTD, to target stalled NSPs for ubiquitylation.","['Listerin', 'Ltn1', 'RQC', 'ribosome', 'structure']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,NY 10065,2016 Jul 19
33410890,Effects of codon usage on gene expression are promoter context dependent.,"Codon usage bias is a universal feature of all genomes. Although codon usage has been shown to regulate mRNA and protein levels by influencing mRNA decay and transcription in eukaryotes, little or no genome-wide correlations between codon usage and mRNA levels are detected in mammalian cells, raising doubt on the significance of codon usage effect on gene expression. Here we show that gene-specific regulation reduces the genome-wide codon usage and mRNA correlations: Constitutively expressed genes exhibit much higher genome-wide correlations than differentially expressed genes from fungi to human cells. Using Drosophila S2 cells as a model system, we showed that the effect of codon usage on mRNA expression level is promoter-dependent. Regions downstream of the core promoters of differentially expressed genes can repress the codon usage effects on mRNA expression. An element in the Hsp70 promoter was identified to be necessary and sufficient for this inhibitory effect. The promoter-dependent codon usage effects on mRNA levels are regulated at the transcriptional level through modulation of histone modifications, nucleosome densities and premature termination. Together, our results demonstrate that promoters play a major role in determining whether codon usage influences gene expression and further establish the transcription-dependent codon usage effects on gene expression.",?,Nucleic acids research,USA,2021 Jan 25

Therefore, we investigated whether the hydrophobic fungal iron chelator siderophore, desferricoprogen (DFC) inhibits atherosclerosis. DFC reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in ApoE(-/-) mice on an atherogenic diet. It lowered the plasma level of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and inhibited lipid peroxidation in aortic roots. The elevated collagen/elastin content and enhanced expression of adhesion molecule VCAM-1 were decreased. DFC diminished oxidation of Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL) and plaque lipids catalyzed by heme or hemoglobin. Formation of foam cells, uptake of oxLDL by macrophages, upregulation of CD36 and increased expression of TNF-alpha were reduced by DFC in macrophages. TNF-triggered endothelial cell activation (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), E-selectin) and increased adhesion of monocytes to endothelium were attenuated. The increased endothelial permeability and intracellular gap formation provoked by TNF-alpha was also prevented by DFC. DFC acted as a cytoprotectant in endothelial cells and macrophages challenged with a lethal dose of oxLDL and lowered the expression of stress-responsive heme oxygenase-1 as sublethal dose was employed. Saturation of desferrisiderophore with iron led to the loss of the beneficial effects. We demonstrated that DFC accumulated within the atheromas of the aorta in ApoE(-/-) mice. DFC represents a novel therapeutic approach to control the progression of atherosclerosis.","['apolipoprotein e knockout mouse', 'atherosclerosis', 'inflammation', 'lipid peroxidation', 'positron emission tomography', 'siderophore']",International journal of molecular sciences,Hungary,2020 Jul 3
28167535,Adaptation of a Genetic Screen Reveals an Inhibitor for Mitochondrial Protein Import Component Tim44.,"Diverse protein import pathways into mitochondria use translocons on the outer membrane (TOM) and inner membrane (TIM). We adapted a genetic screen, based on Ura3 mistargeting from mitochondria to the cytosol, to identify small molecules that attenuated protein import. Small molecule mitochondrial import blockers of the Carla Koehler laboratory (MB)-10 inhibited import of substrates that require the TIM23 translocon. Mutational analysis coupled with molecular docking and molecular dynamics modeling revealed that MB-10 binds to a specific pocket in the C-terminal domain of Tim44 of the protein-associated motor (PAM) complex. This region was proposed to anchor Tim44 to the membrane, but biochemical studies with MB-10 show that this region is required for binding to the translocating precursor and binding to mtHsp70 in low ATP conditions. This study also supports a direct role for the PAM complex in the import of substrates that are laterally sorted to the inner membrane, as well as the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, MB-10 is the first small molecule modulator to attenuate PAM complex activity, likely through binding to the C-terminal region of Tim44.","['chemical biology', 'mitochondria', 'mitochondrial transport', 'protein translocation', 'small molecule']",The Journal of biological chemistry,From the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry and,2017 Mar 31

28955455,Efficient gene editing in Neurospora crassa with CRISPR technology.,"BACKGROUND: Efficient gene editing is a critical tool for investigating molecular mechanisms of cellular processes and engineering organisms for numerous purposes ranging from biotechnology to medicine. Recently developed RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been used for efficient gene editing in various organisms, but has not been tested in a model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa. FINDINGS: In this report, we demonstrate efficient gene replacement in a model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We utilize Cas9 endonuclease and single crRNA:tracrRNA chimeric guide RNA (gRNA) to: (1) replace the endogenous promoter of clr-2 with the beta-tubulin promoter, and (2) introduce a codon optimized fire fly luciferase under the control of the gsy-1 promoter at the csr-1 locus. CLR-2 is one of the core transcription factors that regulate the expression of cellulases, and GSY-1 regulates the conversion of glucose into glycogen. We show that the beta-tubulin promoter driven clr-2 strain shows increased expression of cellulases, and gsy-1-luciferase reporter strain can be easily screened with a bioluminescence assay. CONCLUSION: CRISPR/Cas9 system works efficiently in Neurospora crassa, which may be adapted to Neurospora natural isolates and other filamentous fungi. It will be beneficial for the filamentous fungal research community to take advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 tool kits that enable genetic perturbations including gene replacement and insertions.","['Biofuel', 'CRISPR/Cas9', 'Cellulase', 'Genome editing', 'Homologous recombination', 'Neurospora crassa']",Fungal biology and biotechnology,OH 45267-0576 USA.

31316820,Cryo-EM structure of Neurospora crassa respiratory complex IV.,"In fungi, the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (complexes I-IV) are responsible for oxidative phosphorylation, as in higher eukaryotes. Cryo-EM was used to identify a 200 kDa membrane protein from Neurospora crassa in lipid nanodiscs as cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) and its structure was determined at 5.5 A resolution. The map closely resembles the cryo-EM structure of complex IV from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its ten subunits are conserved in S. cerevisiae and Bos taurus, but other transmembrane subunits are missing. The different structure of the Cox5a subunit is typical for fungal complex IV and may affect the interaction with complex III in a respiratory supercomplex. Additional density was found between the matrix domains of the Cox4 and Cox5a subunits that appears to be specific to N. crassa.","['3D reconstruction and image processing', 'Neurospora crassa', 'automation', 'cryo-electron microscopy', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'respiratory complex IV', 'single-particle cryo-EM', 'structure determination']",IUCrJ,Germany,2019 Jul 1

The eisosome composition of the budding yeast is well described, but there is a limited number of studies only about eisosomes in filamentous fungi. In our study, we examined the Neurospora crassa LSP-1 protein (NcLSP1). By complementing a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Deltapil1 mutant strain with nclsp1, we show the functional homology of the NcLSP1 to yeast PIL1 rather than to yeast LSP1 and hereby confirm that the NcLSP1 is an eisosomal core protein and suitable eisosomal marker. The subsequent cloning and expression of the nclsp1::trfp reporter gene construct in N. crassa allowed for a systematical investigation of the characteristics of eisosome formation and distribution in different developmental stages. In N. crassa, the hyphae germinating from sexual and asexual spores are morphologically identical and have been historically recognized as the same type of cells. Here, we demonstrate the structural differences on the cellular level between the hyphae germinating from sexual and asexual spores.","['CLSM', 'LSP-1', 'Neurospora crassa', 'PIL1', 'eisosome']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",Germany,2023 Jan 22

In this study, seven upregulated and four downregulated ergosterol biosynthesis genes in response to ketoconazole treatment were identified in Neurospora crassa. Azole sensitivity test of knockout mutants for six ketoconazole-upregulated genes in ergosterol biosynthesis revealed that deletion of only sterol C-22 desaturase ERG5 altered sensitivity to azoles: the erg5 mutant was hypersensitive to azoles but had no obvious defects in growth and development. The erg5 mutant accumulated higher levels of ergosta 5,7-dienol relative to the wild type but its levels of 14alpha-methylated sterols were similar to the wild type. ERG5 homologs are highly conserved in fungal kingdom. Deletion of Fusarium verticillioides erg5 also increased ketoconazole sensitivity, suggesting that the roles of ERG5 homologs in azole resistance are highly conserved among different fungal species, and inhibition of ERG5 could reduce the usage of azoles and thus provide a new target for drug design.","['Fusarium verticillioides', 'Neurospora crassa', 'azole', 'ergosterol biosynthesis', 'resistance to antifungal agents']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2013
32759834,Characterization of Single Gene Deletion Mutants Affecting Alternative Oxidase Production in Neurospora crassa: Role of the yvh1 Gene.,"The Neurospora crassa AOD1 protein is a mitochondrial alternative oxidase that passes electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen. The enzyme is encoded by the nuclear aod-1 gene and is produced when the standard electron transport chain is inhibited. We previously identified eleven strains in the N. crassa single gene deletion library that were severely deficient in their ability to produce AOD1 when grown in the presence of chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial translation that is known to induce the enzyme. Three mutants affected previously characterized genes. In this report we examined the remaining mutants and found that the deficiency of AOD1 was due to secondary mutations in all but two of the strains. One of the authentic mutants contained a deletion of the yvh1 gene and was found to have a deficiency of aod-1 transcripts. The YVH1 protein localized to the nucleus and a post mitochondrial pellet from the cytoplasm. A zinc binding domain in the protein was required for rescue of the AOD1 deficiency. In other organisms YVH1 is required for ribosome assembly and mutants have multiple phenotypes. Lack of YVH1 in N. crassa likely also affects ribosome assembly leading to phenotypes that include altered regulation of AOD1 production.","['Neurospora crassa', 'YVH1', 'alternative oxidase', 'mitochondria']",Microorganisms,Canada,2020 Aug 4
31031714,Membrane Sphingolipids Regulate the Fitness and Antifungal Protein Susceptibility of Neurospora crassa.,"The membrane sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) plays an important role in fungal fitness and adaptation to most diverse environments. Moreover, reported differences in the structure of GlcCer between fungi, plants and animals render this pathway a promising target for new generation therapeutics. Our knowledge about the GlcCer biosynthesis in fungi is mainly based on investigations of yeasts, whereas this pathway is less well characterized in molds. We therefore performed a detailed lipidomic profiling of GlcCer species present in Neurospora crassa and comprehensively show that the deletion of genes encoding enzymes involved in GlcCer biosynthesis affects growth, conidiation and stress response in this model fungus. Importantly, our study evidences that differences in the pathway intermediates and their functional role exist between N. crassa and other fungal species. We further investigated the role of GlcCer in the susceptibility of N. crassa toward two small cysteine-rich and cationic antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), PAF and PAFB, which originate from the filamentous ascomycete Penicillium chrysogenum. The interaction of these AMPs with the fungal plasma membrane is crucial for their antifungal toxicity. We found that GlcCer determines the susceptibility of N. crassa toward PAF, but not PAFB. A higher electrostatic affinity of PAFB than PAF to anionic membrane surfaces might explain the difference in their antifungal mode of action.","['Neurospora crassa', 'Penicillium chrysogenum', 'antimicrobial proteins', 'glucosylceramide', 'lipidomics', 'sphingolipids']",Frontiers in microbiology,Austria,2019

Mo-enzymes are crucial for viability throughout all kingdoms of life as they catalyze a diverse set of two electron transfer reactions. The highly conserved Moco biosynthesis pathway consists of four different steps in which guanosine triphosphate is converted into cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate, molybdopterin (MPT), and subsequently adenylated MPT and Moco. Although the enzymes and mechanisms involved in these steps are well characterized, the regulation of eukaryotic Moco biosynthesis is not. Within this work, we described the regulation of Moco biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, which revealed the first step of the multi-step pathway to be under transcriptional control. We found, that upon the induction of high cellular Moco demand a single transcript variant of the nit-7 gene is increasingly formed pointing towards, that essentially the encoded enzyme NIT7-A is the key player for Moco biosynthesis activity in Neurospora.","['Neurospora crassa', 'molybdenum cofactor', 'molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis', 'regulation']",Microorganisms,Germany,2020 Apr 7

33071997,The Composition and the Structure of MCC/Eisosomes in Neurospora crassa.,"MCC/eisosomes are protein-organized domains in the plasma membrane of fungi and algae. However, the composition and function(s) of MCC/eisosomes in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa were previously unknown. To identify proteins that localize to MCC/eisosomes in N. crassa, we isolated proteins that co-purified with the core MCC/eisosome protein LSP-1, which was tagged with GFP. Proteins that co-fractionated with LSP-1:GFP were then identified by mass spectrometry. Eighteen proteins were GFP-tagged and used to identify six proteins that highly colocalized with the MCC/eisosome marker LSP-1:RFP, while five other proteins showed partial overlap with MCC/eisosomes. Seven of these proteins showed amino acid sequence homology with proteins known to localize to MCC/eisosomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, homologs of three proteins known to localize to MCC/eisosomes in S. cerevisiae (Can1, Pkh1/2, and Fhn1) were not found to colocalize with MCC/eisosome proteins in N. crassa by fluorescence microscopy. Interestingly, one new eisosome protein (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase, gene ID: NCU07366) was detected in our studies. These findings demonstrate that there are interspecies differences of the protein composition of MCC/eisosomes. To gain further insight, molecular modeling and bioinformatics analysis of the identified proteins were used to propose the organization of MCC/eisosomes in N. crassa. A model will be discussed for how the broad range of functions predicted for the proteins localized to MCC/eisosomes, including cell wall synthesis, response and signaling, transmembrane transport, and actin organization, suggests that MCC/eisosomes act as organizing centers in the plasma membrane.","['Neurospora crassa', 'cellular localization', 'eisosomal proteins', 'eisosome', 'mass spectrometry']",Frontiers in microbiology,Germany,2020
36963554,Antifungal azoles trigger a xenobiotic detoxification pathway and chitin synthesis in Neurospora crassa.,"The presence of antifungal drugs is prompting the fungal microorganisms to react by mechanisms broader than the resistance. The fungi evolved mechanisms, by which they respond to various stress conditions, including the presence of antifungal compounds. In this work, we studied the response of model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa to azole antifungals in the broader context of the adaptation mechanisms. We demonstrated the increase in expression of filamentous fungi-specific genes encoding cytochrome enzymes of CYP65 clan and plasma membrane-localized ABCC transporters. Azoles appear not to conjugate with glutathione. Surprisingly, the azoles caused changes in the hyphae organization and the amount of chitin in cell wall by the same manner that was thought to be echinocandin-specific. The response to individual azoles appeared to be influenced by the structure of azole compound (prochloraz - main outlier). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of study of stress response mechanisms, specifically in filamentous fungi. Many aspects of the reaction within azoles seem to be similar, though specificities are occurring.","['Neurospora crassa', 'azoles', 'chitin', 'echinocandins', 'glutathione', 'stress response']",Research in microbiology,Slovakia.

35330254,Evaluating the Mode of Antifungal Action of Heat-Stable Antifungal Factor (HSAF) in Neurospora crassa.,"Heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF) isolated from Lysobacter enzymogenes has shown a broad-spectrum of antifungal activities. However, little is known about its mode of action. In this study, we used the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa to investigate the antifungal mechanism of HSAF. We first used HSAF to treat the N. crassa strain at different time points. Spore germination, growth phenotype and differential gene expression analysis were conducted by utilizing global transcriptional profiling combined with genetic and physiological analyses. Our data showed that HSAF could significantly inhibit the germination and aerial hyphae growth of N. crassa. RNA-seq analysis showed that a group of genes, associated with cell wall formation and remodeling, were highly activated. Screening of N. crassa gene deletion mutants combined with scanning electron microscopic observation revealed that three fungal cell wall integrity-related genes played an important role in the interaction between N. crassa and L. enzymogens. In addition, Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), accompanied by confocal microscopy observation revealed that HSAF could trigger autophagy-mediated degradation and eventually result in cell death in N. crassa. The findings of this work provided new insights into the interactions between the predatory Lysobacter and its fungal prey.","['HSAF', 'Neurospora crassa', 'antifungal', 'autophagy', 'cell wall', 'transcriptome']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",China,2022 Mar 1

However, regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes in these species have only been described in different forms by primary scientific literature, which limits the integrated analysis of these data. Here, we extensively curated the reported transcriptional regulatory interactions in Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. For each interaction, the identifiers of involved proteins or genes were unified, and the types of supporting experiments were recorded. Then, transcriptional regulatory networks were reconstructed from the interactions supported by classical low-throughput experiments. Analysis of the networks revealed the presence of hub targets regulated by multiple TFs and network motifs of other structures (e.g., regulatory loops). Comparison of the regulatory interactions between the two species identified 33 conserved interactions supported by classical experiments in both species, most of which are involved in the regulation of metabolic genes. We anticipate the curated data would serve as a catalog for the studies of transcriptional regulation in filamentous fungi.","['Aspergillus nidulans', 'Neurospora crassa', 'filamentous fungi', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptional regulatory network']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2018
28928725,The Neurospora crassa PP2A Regulatory Subunits RGB1 and B56 Are Required for Proper Growth and Development and Interact with the NDR Kinase COT1.,"COT1 is the founding member of the highly conserved nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) Ser/Thr kinase family and plays a role in the regulation of polar growth and development in Neurospora crassa and other fungi. Changes in COT1 phosphorylation state have been shown to affect hyphal elongation, branching, and conidiation. The function of NDR protein kinases has been shown to be regulated by type 2A protein phosphatases (PP2As). PP2As are heterotrimers comprised of a catalytic and scaffolding protein along with an interchangeable regulatory subunit involved in determining substrate specificity. Inactivation of the N. crassa PP2A regulatory subunits rgb-1 and b56 conferred severe hyphal growth defects. Partial suppression of defects observed in the rgb-1(RIP) strain (but not in the Deltab56 mutant) was observed in cot-1 phosphomimetic mutants, demonstrating that altering COT1 phosphorylation state can bypass, at least in part, the requirement of a functional RGB1 subunit. The functional fusion proteins RGB1::GFP and B56::GFP predominantly localized to hyphal tips and septa, respectively, indicating that their primary activity is in different cellular locations. COT1 protein forms exhibited a hyperphosphorylated gel migration pattern in an rgb-1(RIP) mutant background, similar to that observed when the fungus was cultured in the presence of the PP2A inhibitor cantharidin. COT1 was hypophosphorylated in a Deltab56 mutant background, suggesting that this regulatory subunit may be involved in determining COT1 phosphorylation state, yet in an indirect manner. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analyses, using tagged COT1, PPH1, RGB1, and B56 subunits established that these proteins physically interact. Taken together, our data determine the presence of a functional and physical link between PP2A and COT1 and show that two of the PP2A regulatory subunits interact with the kinase and determine COT1 phosphorylation state.","['COT1', 'NDR kinase', 'Neurospora crassa', 'PP2A', 'PR55', 'PR61', 'arthroconidia']",Frontiers in microbiology,Israel,2017
34603088,A C-Terminally Truncated Variant of Neurospora crassa VDAC Assembles Into a Partially Functional Form in the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane and Forms Multimers in vitro.,"The voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) is a porin in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Unlike bacterial porins, several mitochondrial beta-barrels comprise an odd number of beta-strands, as is the case for the 19-beta-stranded VDAC. Previously, a variant of a VDAC from Neurospora crassa, VDAC-DeltaC, lacking the predicted 19th beta-strand, was found to form gated, anion-selective channels in artificial membranes. In vivo, the two C-terminal beta-strands (beta18 and beta19) in VDAC form a beta-hairpin necessary for import from the cytoplasm into mitochondria and the beta-signal required for assembly in the mitochondrial outer membrane resides in beta19. The current study demonstrated that the putative 18-stranded beta-barrel formed by VDAC-DeltaC can be imported and assembled in the MOM in vivo and can also partially rescue the phenotype associated with the deletion of VDAC from a strain of N. crassa. Furthermore, when expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, VDAC-DeltaC can be folded into a beta-strand-rich form in decyl-maltoside. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) alone or combined with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that, unlike full-length VDACs, VDAC-DeltaC can self-organize into dimers and higher order oligomers in the absence of sterol.","['Neurospora crassa', 'VDAC', 'decyl-maltoside', 'dimers', 'mitochondrial porin']",Frontiers in physiology,Canada,2021
33182369,Wild Isolates of Neurospora crassa Reveal Three Conidiophore Architectural Phenotypes.,"The vegetative life cycle in the model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, relies on the development of conidiophores to produce new spores. Environmental, temporal, and genetic components of conidiophore development have been well characterized; however, little is known about their morphological variation. We explored conidiophore architectural variation in a natural population using a wild population collection of 21 strains from Louisiana, United States of America (USA). Our work reveals three novel architectural phenotypes, Wild Type, Bulky, and Wrap, and shows their maintenance throughout the duration of conidiophore development. Furthermore, we present a novel image-classifier using a convolutional neural network specifically developed to assign conidiophore architectural phenotypes in a high-throughput manner. To estimate an inheritance model for this discrete complex trait, crosses between strains of each phenotype were conducted, and conidiophores of subsequent progeny were characterized using the trained classifier. Our model suggests that conidiophore architecture is controlled by at least two genes and has a heritability of 0.23. Additionally, we quantified the number of conidia produced by each conidiophore type and their dispersion distance, suggesting that conidiophore architectural phenotype may impact N. crassa colonization capacity.","['Neurospora crassa', 'complex trait', 'conidiophore development', 'convolutional neural network', 'generalized linear model', 'natural variation', 'phenomics', 'spore shadow']",Microorganisms,USA,2020 Nov 9
25535564,The aging biological clock in Neurospora crassa.,"The biological clock affects aging through ras-1 (bd) and lag-1, and these two longevity genes together affect a clock phenotype and the clock oscillator in Neurospora crassa. Using an automated cell-counting technique for measuring conidial longevity, we show that the clock-associated genes lag-1 and ras-1 (bd) are true chronological longevity genes. For example, wild type (WT) has an estimated median life span of 24 days, while the double mutant lag-1, ras-1 (bd) has an estimated median life span of 120 days for macroconidia. We establish the biochemical function of lag-1 by complementing LAG1 and LAC1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with lag-1 in N. crassa. Longevity genes can affect the clock as well in that, the double mutant lag-1, ras-1 (bd) can stop the circadian rhythm in asexual reproduction (i.e., banding in race tubes) and lengthen the period of the frequency oscillator to 41 h. In contrast to the ras-1 (bd), lag-1 effects on chronological longevity, we find that this double mutant undergoes replicative senescence (i.e., the loss of replication function with time), unlike WT or the single mutants, lag-1 and ras-1 (bd). These results support the hypothesis that sphingolipid metabolism links aging and the biological clock through a common stress response.","['Aging', 'Neurospora crassa', 'bd', 'biological clock', 'lag-1', 'ras-1']",Ecology and evolution,30602,2014 Sep
25691917,A transcriptomic analysis of Neurospora crassa using five major crop residues and the novel role of the sporulation regulator rca-1 in lignocellulase production.,"BACKGROUND: Crop residue is an abundant, low-cost plant biomass material available worldwide for use in the microbial production of enzymes, biofuels, and valuable chemicals. However, the diverse chemical composition and complex structure of crop residues are more challenging for efficient degradation by microbes than are homogeneous polysaccharides. In this study, the transcriptional responses of Neurospora crassa to various plant straws were analyzed using RNA-Seq, and novel beneficial factors for biomass-induced enzyme production were evaluated. RESULTS: Comparative transcriptional profiling of N. crassa grown on five major crop straws of China (barley, corn, rice, soybean, and wheat straws) revealed a highly overlapping group of 430 genes, the biomass commonly induced core set (BICS). A large proportion of induced carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) genes (82 out of 113) were also conserved across the five plant straws. Excluding 178 genes within the BICS that were also upregulated under no-carbon conditions, the remaining 252 genes were defined as the biomass regulon (BR). Interestingly, 88 genes were only induced by plant biomass and not by three individual polysaccharides (Avicel, xylan, and pectin); these were denoted as the biomass unique set (BUS). Deletion of one BUS gene, the transcriptional regulator rca-1, significantly improved lignocellulase production using plant biomass as the sole carbon source, possibly functioning via de-repression of the regulator clr-2. Thus, this result suggests that rca-1 is a potential engineering target for biorefineries, especially for plant biomass direct microbial conversion processes. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional profiling revealed a large core response to different sources of plant biomass in N. crassa. The sporulation regulator rca-1 was identified as beneficial for biomass-based enzyme production.","['Biomass regulon', 'Crop residues', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Transcriptional profiling', 'rca-1']",Biotechnology for biofuels,100049 China,2015
26300971,Involvement of the adaptor protein 3 complex in lignocellulase secretion in Neurospora crassa revealed by comparative genomic screening.,"BACKGROUND: Lignocellulase hypersecretion has been achieved in industrial fungal workhorses such as Trichoderma reesei, but the underlying mechanism associated with this process is not well understood. Although previous comparative genomic studies have revealed that the mutagenic T. reesei strain RUT-C30 harbors hundreds of mutations compared with its parental strain QM6a, how these mutations actually contribute to the hypersecretion phenotype remains to be elucidated. RESULTS: In this study, we systematically screened gene knockout (KO) mutants in the cellulolytic fungus Neurospora crassa, which contains orthologs of potentially defective T. reesei RUT-C30 mutated genes. Of the 86 deletion mutants screened in N. crassa, 12 exhibited lignocellulase production more than 25% higher than in the wild-type (WT) strain and 4 showed nearly 25% lower secretion. We observed that the deletion of Ncap3m (NCU03998), which encodes the mu subunit of the adaptor protein 3 (AP-3) complex in N. crassa, led to the most significant increase in lignocellulase secretion under both Avicel and xylan culture conditions. Moreover, strains lacking the beta subunit of the AP-3 complex, encoded by Ncap3b (NCU06569), had a similar phenotype to DeltaNcap3m, suggesting that the AP-3 complex is involved in lignocellulase secretion in N. crassa. We also found that the transcriptional abundance of major lignocellulase genes in DeltaNcap3m was maintained at a relatively higher level during the late stage of fermentation compared with the WT, which might add to the hypersecretion phenotype. Finally, we found that importation of the T. reesei ap3m ortholog Trap3m into DeltaNcap3m can genetically restore secretion of lignocellulases to normal levels, which suggests that the effect of the AP-3 complex on lignocellulase secretion is conserved in cellulolytic ascomycetes. CONCLUSIONS: Using the model cellulolytic fungus N. crassa, we explored potential hypersecretion-related mutations in T. reesei strain RUT-C30. Through systematic genetic screening of 86 corresponding orthologous KO mutants in N. crassa, we identified several genes, particularly those encoding the AP-3 complex that contribute to lignocellulase secretion. These findings will be useful for strain improvement in future lignocellulase and biomass-based chemical production.","['Adaptor protein 3 complex', 'Lignocellulase secretion', 'Neurospora crassa', 'RUTC30', 'Trichoderma reesei']",Biotechnology for biofuels,130062 China,2015

While not essential for vegetative growth, SAD-9 plays a crucial role in both sexual development and MSUD. Our results suggest that SAD-9, with the help of the SAD-2 scaffold protein, recruits the SMS-2 Argonaute to the perinuclear region, the center of MSUD activity.","['Neurospora crassa', 'DEAD-box RNA helicase', 'RNA interference (RNAi)', 'genome defense', 'meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD)']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",USA,2023 Apr 13
26288653,Deletion of homologs of the SREBP pathway results in hyper-production of cellulases in Neurospora crassa and Trichoderma reesei.,"BACKGROUND: The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa efficiently utilizes plant biomass and is a model organism for genetic, molecular and cellular biology studies. Here, a set of 567 single-gene deletion strains was assessed for cellulolytic activity as compared to the wild-type parental strain. Mutant strains included were those carrying a deletion in: (1) genes encoding proteins homologous to those implicated in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretion apparatus; (2) genes that are homologous to those known to differ between the Trichoderma reesei hyper-secreting strain RUT-C30 and its ancestral wild-type strain; (3) genes encoding proteins identified in the secretome of N. crassa when cultured on plant biomass and (4) genes encoding proteins predicted to traverse the secretory pathway. RESULTS: The 567 single-gene deletion collection was cultured on crystalline cellulose and a comparison of levels of secreted protein and cellulase activity relative to the wild-type strain resulted in the identification of seven hyper-production and 18 hypo-production strains. Some of these deleted genes encoded proteins that are likely to act in transcription, protein synthesis and intracellular trafficking, but many encoded fungal-specific proteins of undetermined function. Characterization of several mutants peripherally linked to protein processing or secretion showed that the hyper- or hypo-production phenotypes were primarily a response to cellulose. The altered secretome of these strains was not limited to the production of cellulolytic enzymes, yet was part of the cellulosic response driven by the cellulase transcription factor CLR-2. Mutants implicated the loss of the SREBP pathway, which has been found to regulate ergosterol biosynthesis genes in response to hypoxic conditions, resulted in a hyper-production phenotype. Deletion of two SREBP pathway components in T. reesei also conferred a hyper-production phenotype under cellulolytic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate the utility of screening the publicly available N. crassa single-gene deletion strain collection for a particular phenotype. Mutants in a predicted E3 ligase and its target SREBP transcription factor played an unanticipated role in protein production under cellulolytic conditions. Furthermore, phenotypes similar to those observed in N. crassa were seen following the targeted deletion of orthologous SREBP pathway loci in T. reesei, a fungal species commonly used in industrial enzyme production.","['Cellulase', 'Cellulose', 'Dsc E3 ligase', 'Lignocellulose', 'Neurospora crassa', 'SREBP', 'Secretion', 'Trichoderma reesei']",Biotechnology for biofuels,CA 94720 USA,2015

30109637,HPLC Analysis of Carotenoids in Neurosporaxanthin-Producing Fungi.,"The ascomycetous fungi Fusarium fujikuroi and Neurospora crassa are widely used as research models in the study of secondary metabolism and photobiology, respectively. Both fungi exhibit a similar carotenoid pathway, for which all the genes and enzymes have been identified. Under standard laboratory conditions, either F. fujikuroi or N. crassa accumulate a mixture of neurosporaxanthin, a carboxylic apocarotenoid acid, and several of its carotene precursors. We formerly described methods for the identification and quantification of neurosporaxanthin. However, the differences in polarity between this acidic xanthophyll and neutral carotenes make their global analysis cumbersome. Here we propose a simple HPLC methodology for the efficient separation of neurosporaxanthin and earlier pathway intermediates in a single HPLC run. This method should be useful to check the abundance of neurosporaxanthin under different experimental conditions and to evaluate the relative proportions of their different carotene precursors. To assess the validity of the method, we have compared the carotenoid profiles in samples of mycelia of F. fujikuroi and conidia of N. crassa, in both cases obtained from surface cultures of a wild strain of each species.","['Acidic apocarotenoid', 'Fusarium fujikuroi', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Neurosporaxanthin', 'Neutral carotenoids', 'RP-HPLC-DAD', 'Xanthophyll']","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Spain,2018
27239448,Pre-mRNA splicing is modulated by antifungal drugs in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.,"For this study, we sought to identify pre-mRNA processing events modulated by changes in extracellular pH, inorganic phosphate, and antifungal drugs. We examined genes with at least four putative introns whose transcriptional level responded to these effectors. We showed that the intron retention levels of genes encoding asparagine synthetase 2, C6-zinc finger regulator (fluffy), and a farnesyltransferase respond to amphotericin B, ketoconazole, and other effectors. In general, the assayed antifungals promoted the disruption of the structural domains of these proteins probably leading to their inactivation, which emphasize the complexity of the metabolic modulation exerted by antifungal signaling.","['Neurospora crassa', 'Pi regulation', 'alternative splicing', 'amphotericin B', 'asparagine synthetase', 'intron retention', 'ketoconazole']",FEBS open bio,Department of Genetics Ribeirao Preto Medical School University of Sao Paulo Ribeirao Preto SP Brazil,2016 Apr
26279678,Cellobionic acid utilization: from Neurospora crassa to Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"BACKGROUND: Economical production of fuels and chemicals from plant biomass requires the efficient use of sugars derived from the plant cell wall. Neurospora crassa, a model lignocellulosic degrading fungus, is capable of breaking down the complex structure of the plant cell wall. In addition to cellulases and hemicellulases, N. crassa secretes lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which cleave cellulose by generating oxidized sugars-particularly aldonic acids. However, the strategies N. crassa employs to utilize these sugars are unknown. RESULTS: We identified an aldonic acid utilization pathway in N. crassa, comprised of an extracellular hydrolase (NCU08755), cellobionic acid transporter (CBT-1, NCU05853) and cellobionic acid phosphorylase (CAP, NCU09425). Extracellular cellobionic acid could be imported directly by CBT-1 or cleaved to gluconic acid and glucose by a beta-glucosidase (NCU08755) outside the cells. Intracellular cellobionic acid was further cleaved to glucose 1-phosphate and gluconic acid by CAP. However, it remains unclear how N. crassa utilizes extracellular gluconic acid. The aldonic acid pathway was successfully implemented in Saccharomyces cerevisiae when N. crassa gluconokinase was co-expressed, resulting in cellobionic acid consumption in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully identified a branched aldonic acid utilization pathway in N. crassa and transferred its essential components into S. cerevisiae, a robust industrial microorganism.","['AA9', 'Aldonic acid', 'Biofuels', 'Cellobionic acid', 'LPMO', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Phosphorylase', 'Transporter', 'beta-glucosidase']",Biotechnology for biofuels,CA USA,2015
22961396,Suppression subtractive hybridization and comparative expression analysis to identify developmentally regulated genes in filamentous fungi.,"Ascomycetes differentiate four major morphological types of fruiting bodies (apothecia, perithecia, pseudothecia and cleistothecia) that are derived from an ancestral fruiting body. Thus, fruiting body differentiation is most likely controlled by a set of common core genes. One way to identify such genes is to search for genes with evolutionary conserved expression patterns. Using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), we selected differentially expressed transcripts in Pyronema confluens (Pezizales) by comparing two cDNA libraries specific for sexual and for vegetative development, respectively. The expression patterns of selected genes from both libraries were verified by quantitative real time PCR. Expression of several corresponding homologous genes was found to be conserved in two members of the Sordariales (Sordaria macrospora and Neurospora crassa), a derived group of ascomycetes that is only distantly related to the Pezizales. Knockout studies with N. crassa orthologues of differentially regulated genes revealed a functional role during fruiting body development for the gene NCU05079, encoding a putative MFS peptide transporter. These data indicate conserved gene expression patterns and a functional role of the corresponding genes during fruiting body development; such genes are candidates of choice for further functional analysis.","['Fruiting body development', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Pyronema confluens', 'Sordaria macrospora', 'Suppression subtractive hybridization']",Journal of basic microbiology,Germany,2013 Sep
31508149,Identification and manipulation of Neurospora crassa genes involved in sensitivity to furfural.,"BACKGROUND: Biofuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass are a viable alternative to fossil fuels required for transportation. Following plant biomass pretreatment, the furan derivative furfural is present at concentrations which are inhibitory to yeasts. Detoxification of furfural is thus important for efficient fermentation. Here, we searched for new genetic attributes in the fungus Neurospora crassa that may be linked to furfural tolerance. The fact that furfural is involved in the natural process of sexual spore germination of N. crassa and that this fungus is highly amenable to genetic manipulations makes it a rational candidate for this study. RESULTS: Both hypothesis-based and unbiased (random promotor mutagenesis) approaches were performed to identify N. crassa genes associated with the response to furfural. Changes in the transcriptional profile following exposure to furfural revealed that the affected processes were, overall, similar to those observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. N. crassa was more tolerant (by ~ 30%) to furfural when carboxymethyl cellulose was the main carbon source as opposed to sucrose, indicative of a link between carbohydrate metabolism and furfural tolerance. We also observed increased tolerance in a Deltacre-1 mutant (CRE-1 is a key transcription factor that regulates the ability of fungi to utilize non-preferred carbon sources). In addition, analysis of aldehyde dehydrogenase mutants showed that ahd-2 (NCU00378) was involved in tolerance to furfural as well as the predicted membrane transporter NCU05580 (flr-1), a homolog of FLR1 in S. cerevisiae. Further to the rational screening, an unbiased approach revealed additional genes whose inactivation conferred increased tolerance to furfural: (i) NCU02488, which affected the abundance of the non-anchored cell wall protein NCW-1 (NCU05137), and (ii) the zinc finger protein NCU01407. CONCLUSIONS: We identified attributes in N. crassa associated with tolerance or degradation of furfural, using complementary research approaches. The manipulation of the genes involved in furan sensitivity can provide a means for improving the production of biofuel producing strains. Similar research approaches can be utilized in N. crassa and other filamentous fungi to identify additional attributes relevant to other furans or toxic chemicals.","['Aldehyde dehydrogenases', 'CRE1', 'Furan', 'Furfural', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Pretreatment']",Biotechnology for biofuels,Israel.

34899653,Coordinated Regulation of Protoperithecium Development by MAP Kinases MAK-1 and MAK-2 in Neurospora crassa.,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways function as signaling hubs that are integral for many essential cellular processes, including sexual development. The molecular mechanisms and cross-talk between PR and CWI MAP kinase pathways have been extensively studied during asexual development. However, if these can be extended to sexual development remains elusive. By analyzing genome-wide transcriptional responses to deletion of each of two MAP kinase coding genes mak-2 (PR-MAP kinase pathway) and mak-1 (CWI-MAP kinase pathway) in Neurospora crassa during protoperithecium formation, 430 genes co-regulated by the MAK-1 and MAK-2 proteins were found, functionally enriched at integral components of membrane and oxidoreductase. These genes include 13 functionally known genes participating in sexual development (app, poi-2, stk-17, fsd-1, vsd-8, and NCU03863) and melanin synthesis (per-1, pkh-1, pkh-2, mld-1, scy-1, trn-2, and trn-1), as well as a set of functionally unknown genes. Phenotypic analysis of deletion mutants for the functionally unknown genes revealed that 12 genes were essential for female fertility. Among them, single-gene deletion mutants for NCU07743 (named as pfd-1), NCU02250 (oli), and NCU05948 (named as pfd-2) displayed similar protoperithecium development defects as the Deltamak-1 and Deltamak-2 mutants, failing to form protoperithecium. Western blotting analysis showed that both phosphorylated and total MAK-1 proteins were virtually abolished in the Deltanrc-1, Deltamek-2, and Deltamak-2 mutants, suggesting that the posttranscriptional regulation of MAK-1 is dependent on the PR-MAP kinase pathway during the protoperithecium development. Taken together, this study revealed the regulatory roles and cross-talk between PR and CWI-MAP kinase pathways during protoperithecium development.","['MAK-1', 'MAK-2', 'MAP kinase', 'Neurospora crassa', 'protoperithecium', 'sexual development']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2021
33176800,Intrinsic disorder is an essential characteristic of components in the conserved circadian circuit.,"INTRODUCTION: The circadian circuit, a roughly 24 h molecular feedback loop, or clock, is conserved from bacteria to animals and allows for enhanced organismal survival by facilitating the anticipation of the day/night cycle. With circadian regulation reportedly impacting as high as 80% of protein coding genes in higher eukaryotes, the protein-based circadian clock broadly regulates physiology and behavior. Due to the extensive interconnection between the clock and other cellular systems, chronic disruption of these molecular rhythms leads to a decrease in organismal fitness as well as an increase of disease rates in humans. Importantly, recent research has demonstrated that proteins comprising the circadian clock network display a significant amount of intrinsic disorder. MAIN BODY: In this work, we focus on the extent of intrinsic disorder in the circadian clock and its potential mechanistic role in circadian timing. We highlight the conservation of disorder by quantifying the extent of computationally-predicted protein disorder in the core clock of the key eukaryotic circadian model organisms Drosophila melanogaster, Neurospora crassa, and Mus musculus. We further examine previously published work, as well as feature novel experimental evidence, demonstrating that the core negative arm circadian period drivers FREQUENCY (Neurospora crassa) and PERIOD-2 (PER2) (Mus musculus), possess biochemical characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins. Finally, we discuss the potential contributions of the inherent biophysical principals of intrinsically disordered proteins that may explain the vital mechanistic roles they play in the clock to drive their broad evolutionary conservation in circadian timekeeping. CONCLUSION: The pervasive conservation of disorder amongst the clock in the crown eukaryotes suggests that disorder is essential for optimal circadian timing from fungi to animals, providing vital homeostatic cellular maintenance and coordinating organismal physiology across phylogenetic kingdoms.

28357255,Extracellular calcium triggers unique transcriptional programs and modulates staurosporine-induced cell death in Neurospora crassa.,"Alterations in the intracellular levels of calcium are a common response to cell death stimuli in animals and fungi and, particularly, in the Neurospora crassa response to staurosporine. We highlight the importance of the extracellular availability of Ca(2+) for this response. Limitation of the ion in the culture medium further sensitizes cells to the drug and results in increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely, an approximately 30-fold excess of external Ca(2+) leads to increased drug tolerance and lower ROS generation. In line with this, distinct staurosporine-induced cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling profiles were observed in the absence or presence of excessive external Ca(2+). High-throughput RNA sequencing revealed that different concentrations of extracellular Ca(2+) define distinct transcriptional programs. Our transcriptional profiling also pointed to two putative novel Ca(2+)-binding proteins, encoded by the NCU08524 and NCU06607 genes, and provides a reference dataset for future investigations on the role of Ca(2+) in fungal biology.","['Ca2+-binding motif', 'Neurospora crassa', 'ROS', 'calcium', 'cell death']","Microbial cell (Graz, Austria)",Portugal,2014 Aug 9
30013270,"New Insights on Cyclization Specificity of Fungal Type III Polyketide Synthase, PKSIIINc in Neurospora crassa.","Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) biosynthesize varied classes of metabolites with diverse bio-functionalities. Inherent promiscuous substrate specificity, multiple elongations of reaction intermediates and several modes of ring-closure, confer the proteins with the ability to generate unique scaffolds from limited substrate pools. Structural studies have identified crucial amino acid residues that dictate type III PKS functioning, though cyclization specific residues need further investigation. PKSIIINc, a functionally and structurally characterized type III PKS from the fungus, Neurospora crassa, is known to biosynthesize alkyl-resorcinol, alkyl-triketide- and alkyl-tetraketide-alpha-pyrone products. In this study, we attempted to identify residue positions governing cyclization specificity in PKSIIINc through comparative structural analysis. Structural comparisons with other type III PKSs revealed a motif with conserved hydroxyl/thiol groups that could dictate PKSIIINc catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys120 and Ser186 to Ser and Cys, respectively, altered product profiles of mutant proteins. While both C120S and S186C proteins retained wild-type PKSIIINc product activity, S186C favoured lactonization and yielded higher amounts of the alpha-pyrone products. Notably, C120S gained new cyclization capability and biosynthesized acyl-phloroglucinol in addition to wild-type PKSIIINc products. Generation of alkyl-resorcinol and acyl-phloroglucinol by a single protein is a unique observation in fungal type III PKS family. Mutation of Cys120 to bulky Phe side-chain abrogated formation of tetraketide products and adversely affected overall protein stability as revealed by molecular dynamics simulation studies. Our investigations identify residue positions governing cyclization programming in PKSIIINc protein and provide insights on how subtle variations in protein cores dictate product profiles in type III PKS family.","['Acyl-phloroglucinol', 'Alkyl-resorcinol', 'Neurospora crassa', 'PKSIIINc', 'Type III polyketide synthase']",Indian journal of microbiology,110021 India.

The Neurospora crassa genome encodes three genes from the GH17 gene family and five members in the GH16 subfamily 18 and 19 fungal chitin transferases. We created deletion mutants lacking all three GH17 genes and determined that they had wild type morphology and are more sensitive to cell wall perturbation reagents than the wild type. We also created deletion mutants lacking all five GH16 subfamily 18 and 19 genes and found that they had wild type morphology and are more sensitive to cell wall perturbation reagents than the wild type. We conclude that GH16 and GH17 enzymes play roles in cell wall biogenesis. In N. crassa, GH72 enzymes have been reported to be lichenin transferases, while in other fungi they have been shown to be the beta-1,3-glucan transferases. Neurospora triple GH72 deletions give rise to a tight colonial morphology, sensitivity to cell wall perturbation reagents, and release of cell wall proteins into the medium. To ask if GH72 and GH17 enzymes might be redundant in N. crassa, we created sextuple mutants lacking the three GH72 genes and the three GH17 genes and found that they were indistinguishable from the GH72 triple mutant. We also found that a recombinant GH72 enzyme is able to form a lichenin-enzyme intermediate demonstrating that GH72 enzymes are lichenin transferases. The N. crassa GH72 enzymes are lichenin transferases and are not redundant with the GH17 beta-1,3-glucan transferases.","['3-glucan', 'Chitin', 'Chitin transferase', 'Fungal Cell Wall', 'GH16', 'GH17', 'Glucan transferase', 'beta-1']","Cell surface (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",United States,2022 Dec
35958129,Untargeted Metabolomics Sheds Light on the Secondary Metabolism of Fungi Triggered by Choline-Based Ionic Liquids.,"Fungal secondary metabolites constitute a rich source of yet undiscovered bioactive compounds. Their production is often silent under standard laboratory conditions, but the production of some compounds can be triggered simply by altering the cultivation conditions. The usage of an organic salt - ionic liquid - as growth medium supplement can greatly impact the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, leading to higher diversity of compounds accumulating extracellularly. This study examines if such supplements, specifically cholinium-based ionic liquids, can support the discovery of bioactive secondary metabolites across three model species: Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Enriched organic extracts obtained from medium supernatant revealed high diversity in metabolites. The supplementation led apparently to increased levels of either 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate or alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. The extracts where bioactive against two major foodborne bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In particular, those retrieved from N. crassa cultures showed greater bactericidal potential compared to control extracts derived from non-supplemented cultures. An untargeted mass spectrometry analysis using the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking tool enabled to capture the chemical diversity driven by the ionic liquid stimuli. Diverse macrolides, among other compounds, were putatively associated with A. fumigatus; whereas an unexpected richness of cyclic (depsi)peptides with N. crassa.

37143353,"Parental effects in a filamentous fungus: Phenotype, fitness and mechanism.","In nature, organisms have to cope with constantly changing environments. In certain conditions, it may be advantageous for the parents to pass on information about the environment, or resources to their offspring. Such transfers are known as parental effects, and they are well documented in plants and animals, but not in other eukaryotes, such as fungi. Many fungi disperse through spores, and fungal spores can potentially carry information or resources to the next generation. Understanding parental effects and their evolutionary consequences in fungi is of vital importance as they perform crucial ecosystem functions. In this study, we investigated whether parental effects are present in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, how long do they last, whether the effects are adaptive, and what is their mechanism. We performed a fully factorial match/mismatch experiment for a good and a poor quality environment, in which we measured the initial growth of strains that experienced either a matched or mismatched environment in their previous generation. We found a strong silver-spoon effect in initial mycelium growth, which lasted for one generation, and increased fitness during competition experiments. By using deletion mutants that lacked key genes in epigenetic processes, we show that epigenetic mechanisms are not involved in this effect. Instead, we show that spore glycogen content, glucose availability and a radical transcription shift in spores are the main mechanisms behind this parental effect.","['Neurospora crassa', 'fungal spore', 'fungi', 'intergenerational effect', 'transgenerational effect']",Molecular ecology,Finland,2023 May 5
29308529,Repeat-induced point (RIP) mutation in the industrial workhorse fungus Trichoderma reesei.,"Trichoderma reesei (syn. Hypocrea jecorina) is a filamentous ascomycete. Due to its capability of producing large amounts of lignocellulolytic enzymes and various heterologous proteins, this fungus has been widely used for industrial applications for over 70 years. It is also a model organism for lignocellulosic biomass degradation and metabolic engineering. Recently, we experimentally and computationally demonstrated that Trichoderma reesei exhibits high homology pairing and repeat-induced point (RIP) mutation activities at a premeiotic stage, i.e., between fertilization and karyogamy or premeiotic DNA replication. The discovery of RIP in Trichoderma reesei not only reveals significant impacts of sexual reproduction on evolution and chromosome architecture but also provides intriguing perspectives for industrial strain improvement. This review emphasizes two major points about RIP and RIP-like processes in Pezizomycotina fungi. First, the molecular mechanisms of RIP and RIP-like processes in Trichoderma reesei and other Pezizomycotina fungi are apparently distinct from those originally described in the model fungus Neurospora crassa. Second, orthologs of the rid1 (deficient in RIP-1) DNA methyltransferase gene were shown to be essential for sexual development in at least four Pezizomycotina fungi, including Trichoderma reesei. In contrast, rid1 is dispensable for Neurospora crassa sexual development. We suggest that the rid1-like gene products and/or their DNA methyltransferase activities play critical roles in promoting fungal sexual development. The Neurospora crassa rid1 gene might have lost this evolutionarily conserved function.","['DNA methyltransferase', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene silencing', 'Meiosis', 'Neurospora', 'Repeat-induced point mutation', 'Sexual development', 'Trichoderma']",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,Taiwan,2018 Feb
26484172,Transcription profiling of the Neurospora crassa response to a group of synthetic (thio)xanthones and a natural acetophenone.,"Xanthones are a class of heterocyclic compounds characterized by a dibenzo-gamma-pyrone nucleus. Analysis of their mode of action in cells, namely uncovering alterations in gene expression, is important because these compounds have potential therapeutic applications. Thus, we studied the transcriptional response of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa to a group of synthetic (thio)xanthone derivatives with antitumor activity using high throughput RNA sequencing. The induction of ABC transporters in N. crassa, particularly atrb and cdr4, is a common consequence of the treatment with xanthones. In addition, we found a group of genes repressed by all of the tested (thio)xanthone derivatives, that are evocative of genes downregulated during oxidative stress. The transcriptional response of N. crassa treated with an acetophenone isolated from the soil fungus Neosartorya siamensis shares some features with the (thio)xanthone-elicited gene expression profiles. Two of the (thio)xanthone derivatives and the N. siamensis-derived acetophenone inhibited the growth of N. crassa.

27990280,Hyphal ontogeny in Neurospora crassa: a model organism for all seasons.,"Filamentous fungi have proven to be a better-suited model system than unicellular yeasts in analyses of cellular processes such as polarized growth, exocytosis, endocytosis, and cytoskeleton-based organelle traffic. For example, the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa develops a variety of cellular forms. Studying the molecular basis of these forms has led to a better, yet incipient, understanding of polarized growth. Polarity factors as well as Rho GTPases, septins, and a localized delivery of vesicles are the central elements described so far that participate in the shift from isotropic to polarized growth. The growth of the cell wall by apical biosynthesis and remodeling of polysaccharide components is a key process in hyphal morphogenesis. The coordinated action of motor proteins and Rab GTPases mediates the vesicular journey along the hyphae toward the apex, where the exocyst mediates vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Cytoplasmic microtubules and actin microfilaments serve as tracks for the transport of vesicular carriers as well as organelles in the tubular cell, contributing to polarization. In addition to exocytosis, endocytosis is required to set and maintain the apical polarity of the cell. Here, we summarize some of the most recent breakthroughs in hyphal morphogenesis and apical growth in N. crassa and the emerging questions that we believe should be addressed.","['apical growth', 'filamentous fungi', 'microtubule', 'polarity']",F1000Research,Mexico,2016
35208654,"Proteomic Shifts Reflecting Oxidative Stress and Reduced Capacity for Protein Synthesis, and Alterations to Mitochondrial Membranes in Neurospora crassa Lacking VDAC.","Voltage-dependent anion-selective channels (VDAC) maintain the bidirectional flow of small metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane and participate in the regulation of multiple cellular processes. To understand the roles of VDAC in cellular homeostasis, preliminary proteomic analyses of S100 cytosolic and mitochondria-enriched fractions from a VDAC-less Neurospora crassa strain (DeltaPor-1) were performed. In the variant cells, less abundant proteins include subunits of translation initiation factor eIF-2, enzymes in the shikimate pathway leading to precursors of aromatic amino acids, and enzymes involved in sulfate assimilation and in the synthesis of methionine, cysteine, alanine, serine, and threonine. In contrast, some of the more abundant proteins are involved in electron flow, such as the alpha subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein and lactate dehydrogenase, which is involved in one pathway leading to pyruvate synthesis. Increased levels of catalase and catalase activity support predicted increased levels of oxidative stress in DeltaPor-1 cells, and higher levels of protein disulfide isomerase suggest activation of the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. DeltaPor-1 cells are cold-sensitive, which led us to investigate the impact of the absence of VDAC on several mitochondrial membrane characteristics. Mitochondrial membranes in DeltaPor-1 are more fluid than those of wild-type cells, the ratio of C18:1 to C18:3n3 acyl chains is reduced, and ergosterol levels are lower. In summary, these initial results indicate that VDAC-less N. crassa cells are characterized by a lower abundance of proteins involved in amino acid and protein synthesis and by increases in some associated with pyruvate metabolism and stress responses. Membrane lipids and hyphal morphology are also impacted by the absence of VDAC.","['Neurospora crassa', 'VDAC', 'amino acid biosynthesis', 'cytosol', 'ergosterol', 'hyphae', 'mitochondria', 'oxidative stress', 'proteomics', 'shikimate', 'unfolded protein response']",Microorganisms,Bangladesh,2022 Jan 18
31024511,"The Zn(II)2Cys6-Type Transcription Factor ADA-6 Regulates Conidiation, Sexual Development, and Oxidative Stress Response in Neurospora crassa.","Conidiation and sexual development are critical for reproduction, dispersal and better-adapted survival in many filamentous fungi. The Neurospora crassa gene ada-6 encodes a Zn(II)2Cys6-type transcription factor, whose deletion resulted in reduced conidial production and female sterility. In this study, we confirmed the positive contribution of ada-6 to conidiation and sexual development by detailed phenotypic characterization of its deletion mutant and the complemented mutant. To understand the regulatory mechanisms of ADA-6 in conidiation and sexual development, transcriptomic profiles generated by RNA-seq from the Deltaada-6 mutant and wild type during conidiation and sexual development were compared. During conidial development, differential expressed genes (DEGs) between the Deltaada-6 mutant and wild type are mainly involved in oxidation-reduction process and single-organism metabolic process. Several conidiation related genes are positively regulated by ADA-6, including genes that positively regulate conidiation (fluffy and acon-3), and genes preferentially expressed during conidial development (eas, con-6, con-8, con-10, con-13, pcp-1, and NCU9357), as the expression of these genes were lower in the Deltaada-6 mutant compared to wild type during conidial development. Phenotypic observation of deletion mutants for other genes with unknown function down-regulated by ada-6 deletion revealed that deletion mutants for four genes (NCU00929, NCU05260, NCU00116, and NCU04813) produced less conidia than wild type. Deletion of ada-6 resulted in female sterility, which might be due to that ADA-6 affects oxidation-reduction process and transmembrane transport process, and positively regulates the transcription of pre-2, poi-2, and NCU05832, three key genes participating in sexual development. In both conidiation and the sexual development process, ADA-6 regulates the transcription of cat-3 and other genes participating in reactive oxygen species production according to RNA-seq data, indicating a role of ADA-6 in oxidative stress response. This was further confirmed by the results that deletion of ada-6 led to hypersensitivity to oxidants H(2)O(2) and menadione. Together, these results proved that ADA-6, as a global regulator, plays a crucial role in conidiation, sexual development, and oxidative stress response of N. crassa.","['Neurospora crassa', 'ada-6', 'conidiation', 'oxidative stress response', 'sexual development']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2019
31114791,Continuous in vivo Metabolism by NMR.,"Dense time-series metabolomics data are essential for unraveling the underlying dynamic properties of metabolism. Here we extend high-resolution-magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) to enable continuous in vivo monitoring of metabolism by NMR (CIVM-NMR) and provide analysis tools for these data. First, we reproduced a result in human chronic lymphoid leukemia cells by using isotope-edited CIVM-NMR to rapidly and unambiguously demonstrate unidirectional flux in branched-chain amino acid metabolism. We then collected untargeted CIVM-NMR datasets for Neurospora crassa, a classic multicellular model organism, and uncovered dynamics between central carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy storage molecules, and lipid and cell wall precursors. Virtually no sample preparation was required to yield a dynamic metabolic fingerprint over hours to days at ~4-min temporal resolution with little noise. CIVM-NMR is simple and readily adapted to different types of cells and microorganisms, offering an experimental complement to kinetic models of metabolism for diverse biological systems.","['BCAA', 'CIVM-NMR', 'HR-MAS', 'Neurospora crassa', 'dynamics', 'flux', 'myeloid leukemia cells', 'real-time metabolomics']",Frontiers in molecular biosciences,United States,2019
35049967,The Resonance and Adaptation of Neurospora crassa Circadian and Conidiation Rhyth ms to Short Light-Dark Cycles.,"Circadian clocks control the physiological and behavioral rhythms to adapt to the environment with a period of ~24 h. However, the influences and mechanisms of the extreme light/dark cycles on the circadian clock remain unclear. We showed that, in Neurospora crassa, both the growth and the microconidia production contribute to adaptation in LD12:12 (12 h light/12 h dark, periodically). Mathematical modeling and experiments demonstrate that in short LD cycles, the expression of the core clock protein FREQUENCY was entrained to the LD cycles when LD > 3:3 while it free ran when T </= LD3:3. The conidial rhythmicity can resonate with a series of different LD conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the existence of unknown blue light photoreceptor(s) and the circadian clock might promote the conidiation rhythms that resonate with the environment. The ubiquitin E3 ligase FWD-1 and the previously described CRY-dependent oscillator system were implicated in regulating conidiation under short LD conditions. These findings shed new light on the resonance of Neurospora circadian clock and conidiation rhythms to short LD cycles, which may benefit the understandings of both the basic regulatory aspects of circadian clock and the adaptation of physiological rhythms to the extreme conditions.","['FREQUENCY (FRQ)', 'Neurospora crassa', 'circadian clock', 'conidiation', 'light/dark cycle']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",China,2021 Dec 29
30633571,Insulin-like and mimetic molecules from non-mammalian organisms: potential relevance for drug discovery.,"Insulin was first discovered in extracts of vertebrate pancreas during a focused search for a therapy for diabetes. Subsequent efforts to discover and isolate a similar active principle from yeast and plants driven by the hope to identify insulin-like/mimetic molecules with critical advantages in the pharmacokinetic profile and expenditure of production compared to authentic human insulin were not successful. As a consequence, it has generally been assumed that hormones evolved exclusively during course of the evolution of vertebrate endocrine organs, implying a rather recent origin. Concomitantly, the existence and physiological role of vertebrate hormones in lower multi- and unicellular eukaryotes have remained a rather controversial subject over decades, albeit there is some evidence that hormones and hormone-binding proteins resembling those of vertebrates are expressed in fungi and yeast. Past and recent findings on the existence of insulin-like and mimetic materials, such as the glucose tolerance factor, in lower eukaryotes, in particular Neurospora crassa and yeast, will be presented. These data provide further evidence for the provocative view that the evolutionary roots of the vertebrate endocrine system may be far more ancient than is generally believed and that the identification and characterisation of insulin-like/mimetic molecules from lower eukaryotes may be useful for future drug discovery efforts.","['Diabetes mellitus', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'glucose tolerance factor', 'insulin', 'phosphoinositolglycans']",Archives of physiology and biochemistry,Germany,2020 Dec
31248072,An Inactivation Switch Enables Rhythms in a Neurospora Clock Model.,"Autonomous endogenous time-keeping is ubiquitous across many living organisms, known as the circadian clock when it has a period of about 24 h. Interestingly, the fundamental design principle with a network of interconnected negative and positive feedback loops is conserved through evolution, although the molecular components differ. Filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a well-established chrono-genetics model organism to investigate the underlying mechanisms. The core negative feedback loop of the clock of Neurospora is composed of the transcription activator White Collar Complex (WCC) (heterodimer of WC1 and WC2) and the inhibitory element called FFC complex, which is made of FRQ (Frequency protein), FRH (Frequency interacting RNA Helicase) and CK1a (Casein kinase 1a). While exploring their temporal dynamics, we investigate how limit cycle oscillations arise and how molecular switches support self-sustained rhythms. We develop a mathematical model of 10 variables with 26 parameters to understand the interactions and feedback among WC1 and FFC elements in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. We performed control and bifurcation analysis to show that our novel model produces robust oscillations with a wild-type period of 22.5 h. Our model reveals a switch between WC1-induced transcription and FFC-assisted inactivation of WC1. Using the new model, we also study the possible mechanisms of glucose compensation. A fairly simple model with just three nonlinearities helps to elucidate clock dynamics, revealing a mechanism of rhythms' production. The model can further be utilized to study entrainment and temperature compensation.","['Neurospora crassa', 'circadian clock', 'glucose compensation', 'mathematical modeling', 'molecular switch']",International journal of molecular sciences,Germany. abhishek.upadhyay@hu-berlin.de,2019 Jun 19
28179391,The Nuclear Cap-Binding Complex Mediates Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA.,"In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, cross walls between individual cells are normally incomplete, making the entire fungal network vulnerable to attack by viruses and selfish DNAs. Accordingly, several genome surveillance mechanisms are maintained to help the fungus combat these repetitive elements. One of these defense mechanisms is called meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD), which identifies and silences unpaired genes during meiosis. Utilizing common RNA interference (RNAi) proteins, such as Dicer and Argonaute, MSUD targets mRNAs homologous to the unpaired sequence to achieve silencing. In this study, we have identified an additional silencing component, namely the cap-binding complex (CBC). Made up of cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80, CBC associates with the 5' cap of mRNA transcripts in eukaryotes. The loss of CBC leads to a deficiency in MSUD activity, suggesting its role in mediating silencing. As confirmed in this study, CBC is predominantly nuclear, although it is known to travel in and out of the nucleus to facilitate RNA transport. As seen in animals but not in plants, CBP20's robust nuclear import depends on CBP80 in Neurospora CBC interacts with a component (Argonaute) of the perinuclear meiotic silencing complex (MSC), directly linking the two cellular factors.","['Neurospora crassa', 'RNA interference (RNAi)', 'cap-binding proteins (CBPs)', 'meiosis', 'meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD)']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",Missouri 65211,2017 Apr 3
30472532,Ultradian Rhythms in the Transcriptome of Neurospora crassa.,"In many organisms, the circadian clock drives rhythms in the transcription of clock-controlled genes that can be either circadian ( approximately 24-hr period) or ultradian (<24-hr period). Ultradian rhythms with periods that are a fraction of 24 hr are termed harmonics. Several harmonic transcripts were discovered in the mouse liver, but their functional significance remains unclear. Using a model-based analysis, we report for the first time  approximately 7-hr third harmonic transcripts in Neurospora crassa, a well-established fungal circadian model organism. Several third harmonic genes are regulated by female fertility 7 (FF-7), whose transcript itself is third harmonic. The knockout of circadian output regulator CSP1 superimposes circadian rhythms on the third harmonic genes, whereas the knockout of stress response regulator MSN1 converts third harmonic rhythms to second harmonic rhythms. The 460  approximately 7-hr genes are co-regulated in two anti-phasic groups in multiple genotypes and include kinases, chromatin remodelers, and homologs of harmonic genes in the mouse liver.","['Biological Sciences', 'Chronobiology', 'Transcriptomics']",iScience,Germany.

31551996,The pH Signaling Transcription Factor PAC-3 Regulates Metabolic and Developmental Processes in Pathogenic Fungi.,"The zinc finger transcription factor PAC-3/RIM101/PacC has a defined role in the secretion of enzymes and proteins in response to ambient pH, and also contributes to the virulence of species. Herein we evaluated the role of PAC-3 in the regulation of Neurospora crassa genes, in a model that examined the plant-fungi interactions. N. crassa is a model fungal species capable of exhibiting dynamic responses to its environment by employing endophytic or phytopathogenic behavior according to a given circumstance. Since plant growth and productivity are highly affected by pH and phosphorus (P) acquisition, we sought to verify the impact that induction of a Deltapac-3 mutation would have under limited and sufficient Pi availability, while ensuring that the targeted physiological adjustments mimicked ambient pH and nutritional conditions required for efficient fungal growth and development. Our results suggest direct regulatory functions for PAC-3 in cell wall biosynthesis, homeostasis, oxidation-reduction processes, hydrolase activity, transmembrane transport, and modulation of genes associated with fungal virulence. Pi-dependent modulation was observed mainly in genes encoding for transporter proteins or related to cell wall development, thereby advancing the current understanding regarding colonization and adaptation processes in response to challenging environments. We have also provided comprehensive evidence that suggests a role for PAC-3 as a global regulator in plant pathogenic fungi, thus presenting results that have the potential to be applied to various types of microbes, with diverse survival mechanisms.","['Neurospora crassa', 'RNA-sequencing', 'inorganic orthophosphate', 'mycorrhizal association', 'phytopathogen']",Frontiers in microbiology,Brazil,2019
29119000,Comparing the physiochemical parameters of three celluloses reveals new insights into substrate suitability for fungal enzyme production.,"BACKGROUND: The industrial applications of cellulases are mostly limited by the costs associated with their production. Optimized production pathways are therefore desirable. Based on their enzyme inducing capacity, celluloses are commonly used in fermentation media. However, the influence of their physiochemical characteristics on the production process is not well understood. In this study, we examined how physical, structural and chemical properties of celluloses influence cellulase and hemicellulase production in an industrially-optimized and a non-engineered filamentous fungus: Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30 and Neurospora crassa. The performance was evaluated by quantifying gene induction, protein secretion and enzymatic activities. RESULTS: Among the three investigated substrates, the powdered cellulose was found to be the most impure, and the residual hemicellulosic content was efficiently perceived by the fungi. It was furthermore found to be the least crystalline substrate and consequently was the most readily digested cellulose in vitro. In vivo however, only RUT-C30 was able to take full advantage of these factors. When comparing carbon catabolite repressed and de-repressed strains of T. reesei and N. crassa, we found that cre1/cre-1 is at least partially responsible for this observation, but that the different wiring of the molecular signaling networks is also relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that crystallinity and hemicellulose content are major determinants of performance. Moreover, the genetic background between WT and modified strains greatly affects the ability to utilize the cellulosic substrate. By highlighting key factors to consider when choosing the optimal cellulosic product for enzyme production, this study has relevance for the optimization of a critical step in the biotechnological (hemi-) cellulase production process.","['Cellulase production', 'Cellulose crystallinity', 'Microcrystalline cellulose', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Powdered cellulose', 'RUT-C30', 'Trichoderma reesei']",Fungal biology and biotechnology,Germany.

28947916,Network reconstruction and systems analysis of plant cell wall deconstruction by Neurospora crassa.,"BACKGROUND: Plant biomass degradation by fungal-derived enzymes is rapidly expanding in economic importance as a clean and efficient source for biofuels. The ability to rationally engineer filamentous fungi would facilitate biotechnological applications for degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides. However, incomplete knowledge of biomolecular networks responsible for plant cell wall deconstruction impedes experimental efforts in this direction. RESULTS: To expand this knowledge base, a detailed network of reactions important for deconstruction of plant cell wall polysaccharides into simple sugars was constructed for the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. To reconstruct this network, information was integrated from five heterogeneous data types: functional genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, genetics, and biochemical characterizations. The combined information was encapsulated into a feature matrix and the evidence weighted to assign annotation confidence scores for each gene within the network. Comparative analyses of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data shed light on the regulation of the plant cell wall degradation network, leading to a novel hypothesis for degradation of the hemicellulose mannan. The transcription factor CLR-2 was subsequently experimentally shown to play a key role in the mannan degradation pathway of N. crassa. CONCLUSIONS: Here we built a network that serves as a scaffold for integration of diverse experimental datasets. This approach led to the elucidation of regulatory design principles for plant cell wall deconstruction by filamentous fungi and a novel function for the transcription factor CLR-2. This expanding network will aid in efforts to rationally engineer industrially relevant hyper-production strains.","['Biofuels', 'CLR-2', 'Mannan', 'Network reconstruction', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Plant cell wall degradation network', 'Systems biology', 'Transcriptional regulatory networks']",Biotechnology for biofuels,WA 98109 USA.

28031787,lac-1 and lag-1 with ras-1 affect aging and the biological clock in Neurospora crassa.,"Using an automated cell counting technique developed previously (Case et al., Ecology and Evolution 2014; 4: 3494), we explore the lifespan effects of lac-1, a ceramide synthase gene paralogous to lag-1 in Neurospora crassa in conjunction with the band bd (ras-1) gene. We find that the replicative lifespan of a lac-1(KO)bd double mutants is short, about one race tube cycle, and this double mutant lacks a strong ~21-hr clock cycle as shown by race tube and fluorometer analysis of fluorescent strains including lac-1(KO) . This short replicative lifespan phenotype is contrasted with a very long estimated chronological lifespan for lac-1(KO)bd double mutants from 247 to 462 days based on our regression analyses on log viability, and for the single mutant lac-1(KO), 161 days. Both of these estimated lifespans are much higher than that of previously studied WT and bd single mutant strains. In a lac-1 rescue and induction experiment, the expression of lac-1(+) as driven by a quinic acid-dependent promoter actually decreases the median chronological lifespan of cells down to only 7 days, much lower than the 34-day median lifespan found in control bd conidia also grown on quinic acid media, which we interpret as an effect of balancing selection acting on ceramide levels based on previous findings from the literature. Prior work has shown phytoceramides can act as a signal for apoptosis in stressed N. crassa cells. To test this hypothesis of balancing selection on phytoceramide levels, we examine the viability of WT, lag-1(KO)bd, and lac-1(KO)bd strains following the dual stresses of heat and glycolysis inhibition, along with phytoceramide treatments of different dosages. We find that the phytoceramide dosage-response curve is altered in the lag-1(KO)bd mutant, but not in the lac-1(KO)bd mutant. We conclude that phytoceramide production is responsible for the previously reported longevity effects in the lag-1(KO)bd mutant, but a different ceramide may be responsible for the longevity effect observed in the lac-1(KO)bd mutant.","['Neurospora crassa', 'aging', 'balancing selection', 'biological clock', 'ceramide', 'circadian rhythms', 'lac-1', 'lag-1']",Ecology and evolution,Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine J.

35205952,Experimental Evolution of Multidrug Resistance in Neurospora crassa under Antifungal Azole Stress.,"Multidrug resistance, defined as the resistance to multiple drugs in different categories, has been an increasing serious problem. Limited antifungal drugs and the rapid emergence of antifungal resistance prompt a thorough understanding of how the occurrence of multidrug resistance develops and which mechanisms are involved. In this study, experimental evolution was performed under single-azole-drug stress with the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. By about 30 weeks of continuous growth on agar plates containing ketoconazole or voriconazole with weekly transfer, four evolved multidrug-resistant strains 30thK1, 30thK2, 26thV1, and 24thV2 were obtained. Compared to the ancestral strain, all four strains increased resistance not only to commonly used azoles, including ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, and triadimefon, but also to antifungal drugs in other categories, including terbinafine (allylamine), amorolfine (morpholine), amphotericin B (polyene), polyoxin B (chitin synthesis inhibitor), and carbendazim (beta-tubulin inhibitor). After 8 weeks of growth on agar plates without antifungal drugs with weekly transfer, these evolved strains still displayed multidrug-resistant phenotype, suggesting the multidrug resistance could be stably inherited. Transcriptional measurement of drug target genes and drug transporter genes and deletion analysis of the efflux pump gene cdr4 in the evolved strains suggest that overexpression of cdr4 played a major role in the resistance mechanisms for azoles and terbinafine in the evolved strains, particularly for 30thK2 and 26thV1, and evolved drug-resistant strains had less intracellular ketoconazole accumulation and less disruption of ergosterol accumulations under ketoconazole stress compared to wild type. Mutations specifically present in evolved drug-resistant strains were identified by genome re-sequencing, and drug susceptibility test of knockout mutants for most of mutated genes suggests that mutations in 16 genes, functionally novel in drug resistance, potentially contribute to multidrug resistance in evolved strains.","['Neurospora crassa', 'azoles', 'experimental evolution', 'multidrug resistance']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",China,2022 Feb 18
32273873,A WD40 Protein Encoding Gene Fvcpc2 Positively Regulates Mushroom Development and Yield in Flammulina velutipes.,"Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are two closely related phyla and fungi in two phyla share some common morphological developmental process during fruiting body formation. In Neurospora crassa, the Gbeta-like protein CPC-2 with a seven-WD40 repeat domain was previously reported. By transforming CPC-2 ortholog encoding genes, from 7 different fungal species across Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, into the cpc-2 deletion mutant of N. crassa, we demonstrate that all tested CPC-2 ortholog genes were able to complement the defects of the cpc-2 deletion mutant in sexual development, indicating that CPC-2 proteins from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota have the similar cellular function. Using Flammulina velutipes as a model system for mushroom species, the CPC-2 ortholog FvCPC2 was characterized. Fvcpc2 increased transcription during fruiting body development. Knockdown of Fvcpc2 by RNAi completely impaired fruiting body formation. In three Fvcpc2 knockdown mutants, transcriptional levels of genes encoding adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A catalytic subunit were significantly lower and colony growth became slower than wild type. The addition of cAMP or the PKA-activator 8-Bromo-cAMP into the medium restored the Fvcpc2 knockdown mutants to the wild-type colony growth phenotype, suggesting that the involvement of cAMP production in the regulatory mechanisms of FvCPC2. Knockdown of Fvcpc2 also weakened transcriptional responses to sexual development induction by some genes related to fruiting body development, including 4 jacalin-related lectin encoding genes, 4 hydrophobin encoding genes, and 3 functionally-unknown genes, suggesting the participation of these genes in the mechanisms by which FvCPC2 regulates fruiting body development. All three Fvcpc2 overexpression strains displayed increased mushroom yield and shortened cultivation time compared to wild type, suggesting that Fvcpc2 can be a promising reference gene for Winter Mushroom breeding. Since the orthologs of FvCPC2 were highly conserved and specifically expressed during fruiting body development in different edible mushrooms, genes encoding FvCPC2 orthologs in other mushroom species also have potential application in breeding.","['Flammulina velutipes', 'Neurospora crassa', 'WD40 protein', 'mushroom breeding', 'sexual development']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2020
25883682,Genome-wide analysis of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response during lignocellulase production in Neurospora crassa.,"BACKGROUND: Lignocellulolytic fungal cells suffer endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during lignocellulase synthesis; however, an understanding of this integrated process on a genome-wide scale remains poor. Here, we undertook a systematic investigation of this process in Neurospora crassa (N. crassa) using transcriptomic analysis coupled with genetic screens. RESULTS: A set of 766 genes was identified as the ER stress response targets (ESRTs) in N. crassa under cellulose utilization conditions. Among these, the expression of 223 and 186 genes showed dependence on IRE-1 and HAC-1, respectively. A total of 527 available mutants for ESRT genes were screened, 249 of which exhibited ER stress susceptibility, including 100 genes with unknown function. Disruption of ire-1 or hac-1 in N. crassa did not affect transcriptional induction of lignocellulase genes by cellulose but severely affected secretion of the corresponding enzymes. A global investigation of transcription factors (TFs) discovered three novel regulators (RES-1, RES-2, RRG-2) involved in lignocellulase secretion. Production of lignocellulases in Deltares-1 increased by more than 30% in comparison to wild type (WT), while secretion decreased by nearly 30% in strains Deltares-2 and Deltarrg-2. Transcriptional profiling of the three TF mutants suggests they are deeply involved in lignocellulase secretion and ER stress response. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we determined the transcriptional scope of the ER stress response during lignocellulase synthesis in the model cellulolytic fungus N. crassa. Through genome-wide mutant screening and analysis, dozens of novel genes were discovered to be involved in the process. The findings of this work will be useful for strain improvement to facilitate lignocellulase and biomass-based chemical production.","['ER stress', 'Lignocellulase secretion', 'RESS', 'RNA-seq', 'Transcription factor', 'UPR']",Biotechnology for biofuels,100049 China,2015

In contrast to more extensively characterized members of the same family, (e.g. Hsp82Sc of Saccharomyces cerevisiae) it exhibits a higher intrinsic ATPase activity and the ability to form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Hsp70 in the absence of co-chaperones or other ancillary factors. As unabridged experimentally derived structures of Hsp80Nc or Hsp82Sc are not available; we developed homology-based models for both of them. A structural analysis and comparison of these models was undertaken to better understand the nature of dimerization-induced changes in secondary structure and patterns of residue interaction. Our studies yielded some interesting and novel insights into the synergistic and mutually reinforcing nature of interactions between major domains of the two chains in their dimeric forms. We also evaluated the effect of residue substitutions in the 'lid' region of Hsp80Nc and Hsp82Sc on the calculated ligand-binding energy of ATP (and ADP) to their respective N-terminal domains. Our studies suggest that the higher intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp80Nc may be attributable to differences in the residue sequences between the lid region of these two proteins.","['Homology modeling', 'Hsp90s', 'Ligand docking simulation', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae']",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,Canada,2013 Jul
28616073,The transcription factor PDR-1 is a multi-functional regulator and key component of pectin deconstruction and catabolism in Neurospora crassa.,"BACKGROUND: Pectin is an abundant component in many fruit and vegetable wastes and could therefore be an excellent resource for biorefinery, but is currently underutilized. Fungal pectinases already play a crucial role for industrial purposes, such as for foodstuff processing. However, the regulation of pectinase gene expression is still poorly understood. For an optimal utilization of plant biomass for biorefinery and biofuel production, a detailed analysis of the underlying regulatory mechanisms is warranted. In this study, we applied the genetic resources of the filamentous ascomycete species Neurospora crassa to screen for transcription factors that play a major role in pectinase induction. RESULTS: The pectin degradation regulator-1 (PDR-1) was identified through a transcription factor mutant screen in N. crassa. The Deltapdr-1 mutant exhibited a severe growth defect on pectin and all tested pectin-related poly- and monosaccharides. Biochemical as well as transcriptional analyses of WT and the Deltapdr-1 mutant revealed that while PDR-1-mediated gene induction was dependent on the presence of l-rhamnose, it also strongly affected the degradation of the homogalacturonan backbone. The expression of the endo-polygalacturonase gh28-1 was greatly reduced in the Deltapdr-1 mutant, while the expression levels of all pectate lyase genes increased. Moreover, a pdr-1 overexpression strain displayed substantially increased pectinase production. Promoter analysis of the PDR-1 regulon allowed refinement of the putative PDR-1 DNA-binding motif. CONCLUSIONS: PDR-1 is highly conserved in filamentous ascomycete fungi and is present in many pathogenic and industrially important fungi. Our data demonstrate that the function of PDR-1 in N. crassa combines features of two recently described transcription factors in Aspergillus niger (RhaR) and Botrytis cinerea (GaaR).

In Neurospora crassa, the dual-affinity glucose transport system consists of a low-affinity glucose transporter GLT-1 and two high-affinity glucose transporters HGT-1/HGT-2, which play diverse roles in glucose transport, carbon metabolism, and cellulase expression regulation. However, the regulation of this dual-transporter system in response to environmental glucose fluctuation is not yet clear. RESULTS: In this study, we report that a regulation module consisting of a downstream transcription factor COL-26 and an upstream non-transporting glucose sensor RCO-3 regulates the dual-affinity glucose transport system in N. crassa. COL-26 directly binds to the promoter regions of glt-1, hgt-1, and hgt-2, whereas RCO-3 is an upstream factor of the module whose deletion mutant resembles the Deltacol-26 mutant phenotypically. Transcriptional profiling analysis revealed that Deltacol-26 and Deltarco-3 mutants had similar transcriptional profiles, and both mutants had impaired response to a glucose gradient. We also showed that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex is involved in regulation of the glucose transporters. AMPK is required for repression of glt-1 expression in starvation conditions by inhibiting the activity of RCO-3. CONCLUSIONS: RCO-3 and COL-26 form an external-to-internal module that regulates the glucose dual-affinity transport system. Transcription factor COL-26 was identified as the key regulator. AMPK was also involved in the regulation of the dual-transporter system. Our findings provide novel insight into the molecular basis of glucose uptake and signaling in filamentous fungi, which may aid in the rational design of fungal strains for industrial purposes.","['Gene regulation', 'Glucose transport', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Phosphoproteome', 'RNA-seq', 'Transcription factor']",Biotechnology for biofuels,China,2021 Jan 28
30554169,Nucleosome Positioning by an Evolutionarily Conserved Chromatin Remodeler Prevents Aberrant DNA Methylation in Neurospora.,"In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, constitutive heterochromatin is marked by tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and DNA methylation. We identified mutations in the Neurospora defective in methylation-1 (dim-1) gene that cause defects in cytosine methylation and implicate a putative AAA-ATPase chromatin remodeler. Although it was well-established that chromatin remodelers can affect transcription by influencing DNA accessibility with nucleosomes, little was known about the role of remodelers on chromatin that is normally not transcribed, including regions of constitutive heterochromatin. We found that dim-1 mutants display both reduced DNA methylation in heterochromatic regions as well as increased DNA methylation and H3K9me3 in some intergenic regions associated with highly expressed genes. Deletion of dim-1 leads to atypically spaced nucleosomes throughout the genome and numerous changes in gene expression. DIM-1 localizes to both heterochromatin and intergenic regions that become hyper-methylated in dim-1 strains. Our findings indicate that DIM-1 normally positions nucleosomes in both heterochromatin and euchromatin and that the standard arrangement and density of nucleosomes is required for the proper function of heterochromatin machinery.","['CATP', 'DIM-1', 'DNA methylation', 'Neurospora crassa', 'heterochromatin', 'nucleosome']",Genetics,Oregon 97403 selker@uoregon.edu aklocko@uccs.edu,2019 Feb

In this study, we found that the deletion mutant of col-26, which encodes an AmyR-like transcription factor that acts in CCR, displayed sorbose resistance. In contrast, the deletion mutants of other CCR genes, such as a hexokinase (hxk-2), an AMP-activated S/T protein kinase (prk-10), and a transcription factor (cre-1), showed no sorbose resistance. Double mutant analysis revealed that the deletion of hxk-2, prk-10, and cre-1 did not affect the sorbose resistance of the col-26 mutant. Genes for a glucoamylase (gla-1), an invertase (inv), and glucose transporters (glt-1 and hgt-1) were highly expressed in the cre-1 mutant, even in glucose-rich conditions, but this upregulation was suppressed in the Deltacre-1;Deltacol-26a double-deletion mutant. Furthermore, we found that a dgr-2(L1)a mutant with a single amino-acid substitution, S11L, in the F-box protein EXO-1 displayed sorbose resistance, unlike the deletion mutants of exo-1, suggesting that the function of EXO-1 is crucial for the resistance. Our data strongly suggest that CCR directly participates in sorbose resistance, and that COL-26 and EXO-1 play important roles in regulating the amylase and glucose transporter genes during CCR.","['Neurospora', 'amylase', 'cellulose', 'glucose repression', 'glucose transporter']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",Japan,2022 Nov 6

31511298,Regulation of the Neurospora Circadian Clock by the Spliceosome Component PRP5.,"Increasing evidence has pointed to the connection between pre-mRNA splicing and the circadian clock; however, the underlying mechanisms of this connection remain largely elusive. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the core circadian clock elements comprise White Collar 1 (WC-1), WC-2 and FREQUENCY (FRQ), which form a negative feedback loop to control the circadian rhythms of gene expression and physiological processes. Previously, we have shown that in Neurospora, the pre-mRNA splicing factors Pre-mRNA-processing ATP-dependent RNA helicase 5 (PRP5), protein arginine methyl transferase 5 (PRMT5) and snRNA gene U4-2 are involved in the regulation of splicing of frq transcripts, which encode the negative component of the circadian clock system. In this work we further demonstrated that repression of spliceosomal component sRNA genes, U5, U4-1, and prp5, affected the circadian conidiation rhythms. In a prp5 knockdown strain, the molecular rhythmicity was dampened. The expression of a set of snRNP genes including prp5 was up-regulated in a mutant strain lacking the clock component wc-2, suggesting that the function of spliceosome might be under the circadian control. Among these snRNP genes, the levels of prp5 RNA and PRP5 protein oscillated. The distribution of PRP5 in cytosol was rhythmic, suggesting a dynamic assembly of PRP5 in the spliceosome complex in a circadian fashion. Silencing of prp5 caused changes in the transcription and splicing of NCU09649, a clock-controlled gene. Moreover, in the clock mutant frq(9) , the rhythmicity of frq I-6 splicing was abolished. These data shed new lights on the regulation of circadian clock by the pre-RNA splicing, and PRP5 may link the circadian clock and pre-RNA splicing events through mediating the assembly and function of the spliceosome complex.","['Neurospora crassa', 'PRP5', 'alternative splicing', 'circadian clock', 'spliceosome']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",China,2019 Nov 5
31736884,Broad Substrate-Specific Phosphorylation Events Are Associated With the Initial Stage of Plant Cell Wall Recognition in Neurospora crassa.,"Fungal plant cell wall degradation processes are governed by complex regulatory mechanisms, allowing the organisms to adapt their metabolic program with high specificity to the available substrates. While the uptake of representative plant cell wall mono- and disaccharides is known to induce specific transcriptional and translational responses, the processes related to early signal reception and transduction remain largely unknown. A fast and reversible way of signal transmission are post-translational protein modifications, such as phosphorylations, which could initiate rapid adaptations of the fungal metabolism to a new condition. To elucidate how changes in the initial substrate recognition phase of Neurospora crassa affect the global phosphorylation pattern, phospho-proteomics was performed after a short (2 min) induction period with several plant cell wall-related mono- and disaccharides. The MS/MS-based peptide analysis revealed large-scale substrate-specific protein phosphorylation and de-phosphorylations. Using the proteins identified by MS/MS, a protein-protein-interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The variance in phosphorylation of a large number of kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors indicate the participation of many known signaling pathways, including circadian responses, two-component regulatory systems, MAP kinases as well as the cAMP-dependent and heterotrimeric G-protein pathways. Adenylate cyclase, a key component of the cAMP pathway, was identified as a potential hub for carbon source-specific differential protein interactions. In addition, four phosphorylated F-Box proteins were identified, two of which, Fbx-19 and Fbx-22, were found to be involved in carbon catabolite repression responses. Overall, these results provide unprecedented and detailed insights into a so far less well known stage of the fungal response to environmental cues and allow to better elucidate the molecular mechanisms of sensory perception and signal transduction during plant cell wall degradation.","['Neurospora crassa', 'fungi', 'lignocellulose degradation', 'phosphorylation', 'proteomics', 'signal transduction', 'substrate recognition']",Frontiers in microbiology,Germany,2019
28229961,Neurospora tetrasperma crosses heterozygous for hybrid translocation strains produce rare eight-spored asci-bearing heterokaryotic ascospores.,"During ascogenesis in Neurospora, the ascospores are partitioned at the eight-nucleus stage that follows meiosis and a post-meiotic mitosis, and the ascospores that form in eight-spored asci are usually homokaryotic. We had previously created novel TNt strains by introgressing four Neurospora crassa insertional translocations (EB4, IBj5, UK14-1, and B362i) into N. tetrasperma. We now show that crosses of all the TNt strains with single-mating-type derivatives of the standard N. tetrasperma pseudohomothallic strain 85 (viz. T(Nt)a x 85A or T(Nt)A x 85a) can produce rare eight-spored asci that contain heterokaryotic ascospores, or ascospores with other unexpected genotypes. Our results suggest that these rare asci result from the interposition of additional mitoses between the post-meiotic mitosis and the partitioning of nuclei into ascospores, leading to the formation of supernumerary nuclei that then generate the heterokaryotic ascospores. The rare asci probably represent a background level of ascus dysgenesis wherein the partitioning of ascospores becomes uncoupled from the post-meiotic mitosis. Ordinarily, the severest effect of such dysgenesis, the production of mating-type heterokaryons, would be suppressed by the N. crassa tol (tolerant) gene, thus explaining why such dysgenesis remained undetected thus far.",?,Journal of biosciences,kas@cdfd.org.in,2017 Mar
30302531,"A-to-I mRNA editing in fungi: occurrence, function, and evolution.","A-to-I RNA editing is an important post-transcriptional modification that converts adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in RNA molecules via hydrolytic deamination. Although editing of mRNAs catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in metazoans, organisms outside the animal kingdom lacking ADAR orthologs were thought to lack A-to-I mRNA editing. However, recent discoveries of genome-wide A-to-I mRNA editing during the sexual stage of the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum, model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, Sordaria macrospora, and an early diverging filamentous ascomycete Pyronema confluens indicated that A-to-I mRNA editing is likely an evolutionarily conserved feature in filamentous ascomycetes. More importantly, A-to-I mRNA editing has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in different sexual developmental processes and display distinct tissue- or development-specific regulation. Contrary to that in animals, the majority of fungal RNA editing events are non-synonymous editing, which were shown to be generally advantageous and favored by positive selection. Many non-synonymous editing sites are conserved among different fungi and have potential functional and evolutionary importance. Here, we review the recent findings about the occurrence, regulation, function, and evolution of A-to-I mRNA editing in fungi.","['ADAR', 'ADAT', 'Adaptation', 'Adenosine', 'Deamination', 'Epigenetic', 'Fusarium graminearum', 'Inosine', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Non-synonymous editing', 'RNA modification', 'Sexual reproduction']",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,USA,2019 Jan
32584919,The PAC-3 transcription factor critically regulates phenotype-associated genes in Neurospora crassa.,"Transcription factors play an important role in fungal environmental adaptive process by promoting adjustment to challenging stimuli via gene modulation and activation of signaling networks. The transcription factor encoded by the pac-3/rim101/pacC gene is involved in pH regulation and is associated with a wide variety of cellular functions. The deletion of pac-3 affects fungal development. In Neurospora crassa, the Deltapac-3 strain presents diminished aerial growth and reduced conidiation. However, the PAC-3-regulated genes associated with this altered phenotype have not been elucidated. In this study, we used RNA-seq to analyze the phenotypic plasticity induced after pac-3 deletion in the filamentous fungus N. crassa cultivated in media supplemented with sufficient or limited inorganic phosphate. Genes related to morphology, hyphal development, and conidiation were of particular interest in this study. Our results suggest a pac-3 dependency in gene regulation in a Pi-dependent manner. Furthermore, our analysis suggested that the fungus attempts to overcome the deletion effects in a Deltapac-3 mutant through a complex combined regulatory mechanism. Finally, the modulatory responses observed in the Deltapac-3 strain, a double mutant generated based on the Deltamus-52 mutant strain, is strain-specific, highlighting that the phenotypic impact may be attributed to pac-3 absence despite the combined mus-52 deletion.",?,Genetics and molecular biology,Brazil,2020
36577368,A circadian clock translational control mechanism targets specific mRNAs to cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules.,"Phosphorylation of Neurospora crassa eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha), a conserved translation initiation factor, is clock controlled. To determine the impact of rhythmic eIF2alpha phosphorylation on translation, we performed temporal ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in wild-type (WT), clock mutant Deltafrq, eIF2alpha kinase mutant Deltacpc-3, and constitutively active cpc-3(c) cells. About 14% of mRNAs are rhythmically translated in WT cells, and translation rhythms for  approximately 30% of these mRNAs, which we named circadian translation-initiation-controlled genes (cTICs), are dependent on the clock and CPC-3. Most cTICs are expressed from arrhythmic mRNAs and contain a P-body (PB) localization motif in their 5' leader sequence. Deletion of SNR-1, a component of cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules (cmRNPgs) that include PBs and stress granules (SGs), and the PB motif on one of the cTIC mRNAs, zip-1, significantly alters zip-1 rhythmic translation. These results reveal that the clock regulates rhythmic translation of specific mRNAs through rhythmic eIF2alpha activity and cmRNPg metabolism.","['CP: Molecular biology', 'CPC-3', 'GCN2', 'Neurospora crassa', 'P-body', 'circadian clock', 'cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules', 'eIF2alpha', 'ribosome profiling', 'translation control']",Cell reports,USA,2022 Dec 27
34765745,Purification and characterization of recombinant FAD synthetase from Neurospora crassa.,"FAD Synthetase (FADS) [EC 2.7.7.2], the second enzyme in flavin cofactor biosynthetic pathway converts FMN to FAD, plays an important role in many redox reactions. Neurospora crassa FADS (NcFADS) was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli cells. Recombinant NcFADS was purified in high yields of  approximately 8 mg per liter of bacterial culture using a single step glutathione sepharose affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and MALDI-MS revealed that NcFADS has a molecular mass of  approximately 31 kDa. Enzyme kinetic analysis monitored by reverse phase HPLC demonstrate a specific activity and k(cat) of 1356 nmol/min/mg and 0.69sec(-1) respectively. Steady state kinetic analysis of NcFADS exhibited a K(m) of NcFADS for FMN is 2.7 muM and for MgATP(-2) is 88.7 muM. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments showed that the recombinant protein binds to the substrates with apparent K(d) of 20.8 muM for FMN and 16.6 muM for MgATP(-2). Biophysical characterization using intrinsic fluorescence suggests that the enzyme is in folded conformation. Far-UV CD data suggest that the backbone of the enzyme is predominantly in a helical conformation. Differential scanning calorimetry data shows that the T(m) is 53  degrees C +/- 1. This is the first report on cloning, purification and characterization of FADS from N. crassa. The specific activity of NcFADS is the highest than any of the reported FADS from any other source. The results obtained in this study is expected to pave way for intensive research aimed to understand the molecular basis for the extraordinarily high turnover rate of NcFADS.","['Enzyme kinetics', 'Flavo proteins', 'Intrinsic fluorescence']",Biochemistry and biophysics reports,India,2021 Dec

25154020,Light-mediated participation of the VIVID-like protein of Fusarium fujikuroi VvdA in pigmentation and development.,"The phytopathogen Fusarium fujikuroi is a model fungus for the production of different secondary metabolites. These include the acidic xanthophyll neurosporaxanthin, produced through the activity of the enzymes encoded by the car genes, of which carRA and carB play a major role. Expression of these genes is induced by light but, in contrast to other fungi, the induction is not impaired under continuous illumination in null mutants of the F. fujikuroi wc-1-like gene, wcoA. Therefore, we investigate the role of other blue-light photoreceptors. Here we describe the identification, regulation and targeted mutation of the F. fujikuroi gene vvdA, homologous of the Neurospora crassa vivid (vvd) gene. As found for vvd in N. crassa, expression of vvdA in F. fujikuroi is strongly stimulated by light, an activation that is severely reduced in the wcoA mutants. Deletion of vvdA in F. fujikuroi results in a paler pigmentation under constant light, explained by a reduced carotenoid production, a regulatory effect opposite to the enhanced carotenoid accumulation characteristic of the vvd mutants of N. crassa. No major changes were appreciated in the transcriptional regulation of the car genes following exposure to light, but a noticeable reduction was found upon long-term incubation under constant illumination. Additionally, the vvdA mutants produce less conidia and their colonies exhibit morphological alterations under constant light, such as a more compact development of aerial mycelia and a more solid attachment to the agar surface. The results indicate that VvdA participates in the regulation by light of mycelial development and affects the accumulation of carotenoids but it is not responsible of the transcriptional photoadaptation of the car genes.","['Carotenoids', 'Conidiation', 'Mycelia development', 'Photoinduction', 'VIVID photoreceptor']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Spain,2014 Oct
28527179,Making Time: Conservation of Biological Clocks from Fungi to Animals.,"The capacity for biological timekeeping arose at least three times through evolution, in prokaryotic cyanobacteria, in cells that evolved into higher plants, and within the group of organisms that eventually became the fungi and the animals. Neurospora is a tractable model system for understanding the molecular bases of circadian rhythms in the last of these groups, and is perhaps the most intensively studied circadian cell type. Rhythmic processes described in fungi include growth rate, stress responses, developmental capacity, and sporulation, as well as much of metabolism; fungi use clocks to anticipate daily environmental changes. A negative feedback loop comprises the core of the circadian system in fungi and animals. In Neurospora, the best studied fungal model, it is driven by two transcription factors, WC-1 and WC-2, that form the White Collar Complex (WCC). WCC elicits expression of the frq gene. FRQ complexes with other proteins, physically interacts with the WCC, and reduces its activity; the kinetics of these processes is strongly influenced by progressive phosphorylation of FRQ. When FRQ becomes sufficiently phosphorylated that it loses the ability to influence WCC activity, the circadian cycle starts again. Environmental cycles of light and temperature influence frq and FRQ expression and thereby reset the internal circadian clocks. The molecular basis of circadian output is also becoming understood. Taken together, molecular explanations are emerging for all the canonical circadian properties, providing a molecular and regulatory framework that may be extended to many members of the fungal and animal kingdoms, including humans.",?,Microbiology spectrum,NH 03755,2017 May
28761009,Ascus dysgenesis in hybrid crosses of Neurospora and Sordaria (Sordariaceae).,"When two lineages derived from a common ancestor become reproductively isolated (e.g. Neurospora crassa and N. tetrasperma), genes that have undergone mutation and adaptive evolution in one lineage can potentially become dysfunctional when transferred into the other, since other genes have undergone mutation and evolution in the second lineage, and the derived alleles were never 'tested' together before hybrid formation. Bateson (1909), Dobzhansky (1936), and Muller (1942) recognized that incompatibility between the derived alleles could potentially make the hybrid lethal, sterile, or display some other detriment. Alternatively, the detrimental effects seen in crosses with the hybrids may result from the silencing of ascus-development genes by meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). Aberrant transcripts from genes improperly paired in meiosis are processed into single-stranded MSUD-associated small interfering RNA (masiRNA), which is used to degrade complementary mRNA. Recently, backcrosses of N. crassa / N. tetrasperma hybrid translocation strains with wild-type N. tetrasperma were found to elicit novel ascus dysgenesis phenotypes. One was a transmission ratio distortion that apparently disfavoured the homokaryotic ascospores formed following alternate segregation. Another was the production of heterokaryotic ascospores in eight-spored asci. Lewis (1969) also had reported sighting rare eight-spored asci with heterokaryotic ascospores in interspecific crosses in Sordaria, a related genus. Ordinarily, in both Neurospora and Sordaria, the ascospores are partitioned at the eight-nucleus stage, and ascospores in eight-spored asci are initially uninucleate. Evidently, in hybrid crosses of the family Sordariaceae, ascospore partitioning can be delayed until after one or more mitoses following the postmeiotic mitosis.",?,Journal of genetics,India. kas@cdfd.org.in,2017 Jul
35257662,The ACF chromatin-remodeling complex is essential for Polycomb repression.,"Establishing and maintaining appropriate gene repression is critical for the health and development of multicellular organisms. Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation is a chromatin modification associated with repressed facultative heterochromatin, but the mechanism of this repression remains unclear. We used a forward genetic approach to identify genes involved in transcriptional silencing of H3K27-methylated chromatin in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We found that the N. crassa homologs of ISWI (NCU03875) and ACF1 (NCU00164) are required for repression of a subset of H3K27-methylated genes and that they form an ACF chromatin-remodeling complex. This ACF complex interacts with chromatin throughout the genome, yet association with facultative heterochromatin is specifically promoted by the H3K27 methyltransferase, SET-7. H3K27-methylated genes that are upregulated when iswi or acf1 are deleted show a downstream shift of the +1 nucleosome, suggesting that proper nucleosome positioning is critical for repression of facultative heterochromatin. Our findings support a direct role of the ACF complex in Polycomb repression.","['H3K27 methylation', 'ISWI', 'N. crassa', 'PRC2', 'chromatin remodeler', 'chromosomes', 'facultative heterochromatin', 'gene expression', 'genetics', 'genomics', 'nucleosome positioning']",eLife,United States,2022 Mar 8

36620034,The Neurospora crassa PCL-1 cyclin is a PHO85-1 (PGOV) kinase partner that directs the complex to glycogen metabolism and is involved in calcium metabolism regulation.,"Cyclins are a family of proteins characterized by possessing a cyclin box domain that mediates binding to cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) partners. In this study, the search for a partner cyclin of the PHO85-1 CDK retrieved PCL-1 an ortholog of yeast Pcls (for Pho85 cyclins) that performs functions common to Pcls belonging to different cyclin families. We show here that PCL-1, as a typical cyclin, is involved in cell cycle control and cell progression. In addition, PCL-1 regulates glycogen metabolism; Deltapcl-1 cells accumulate higher glycogen levels than wild-type cells and the glycogen synthase (GSN) enzyme is less phosphorylated and, therefore, more active in the mutant cells. Together with PHO85-1, PCL-1 phosphorylates in vitro GSN at the Ser636 amino acid residue. Modeling studies identified PHO85-1 and PCL-1 as a CDK/cyclin complex, with a conserved intermolecular region stabilized by hydrophobic and polar interactions. PCL-1 is also involved in calcium and NaCl stress response. Deltapcl-1 cells are sensitive to high NaCl concentration; on the contrary, they grow better and overexpress calcium responsive genes under high calcium chloride concentration compared to the wild-type strain. The expression of the calcium-responsive CRZ-1 transcription factor is modulated by PCL-1, and this transcription factor seems to be less phosphorylated in Deltapcl-1 cells since exhibits nuclear location in these cells in the absence of calcium. Our results show that PCL-1 locates at different cell regions suggesting that it may determine its activity by controlling its intracellular location and reveal an interesting functional divergence between yeast and filamentous fungus cyclins.","['CDK/cyclin complex', 'CRZ-1 transcription factor', 'Neurospora crassa', 'protein phosphorylation', 'stress response']",Frontiers in microbiology,Brazil,2022

32438044,Evidence of repeated horizontal transfer of sterol C-5 desaturase encoding genes among dikarya fungi.,"Gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are two important but different forces for adaptive genome evolution. In eukaryotic organisms, gene duplication is considered to play a more important evolutionary role than HGT. However, certain fungal lineages have developed highly efficient mechanisms that avoid the occurrence of duplicated gene sequences within their genomes. While these mechanisms likely originated as a defense against harmful mobile genetic elements, they come with an evolutionary cost. A prominent example for a genome defense system is the RIP mechanism of the ascomycete fungus Neurospora crassa, which efficiently prevents sequence duplication within the genome and functional redundancy of the subsequent paralogs. Despite this tight control, the fungus possesses two functionally redundant sterol C-5 desaturase enzymes, ERG-10a and ERG-10b, that catalyze the same step during ergosterol biosynthesis. In this study, we addressed this conundrum by phylogenetic analysis of the two proteins and supporting topology tests. We obtained evidence that a primary HGT of a sterol C-5 desaturase gene from Tremellales (an order of Basidiomycota) into a representative of the Pezizomycotina (a subphylum of Ascomycota) is the origin of the ERG-10b sequence. The reconstructed phylogenies suggest that this HGT event was followed by multiple HGT events among other members of the Pezizomycotina, thereby generating a diverse group with members in the four classes Sordariomycetes, Xylonomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes, which all harbor the second sterol C-5 desaturase or maintained in some cases only the ERG-10b version of this enzyme. These results furnish an example for a gene present in numerous ascomycetous fungi but primarily acquired by an ancestral HGT event from another fungal phylum. Furthermore, these data indicate that HGT represents one mechanism to generate functional redundancy in organisms with a strict avoidance of gene duplications.","['Ascomycota', 'Basidiomycota', 'Ergosterol biosynthesis', 'Fungi', 'Genome defense', 'Horizontal gene transfer', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Sterol C-5 desaturase']",Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,Germany,2020 Sep
30364194,Changes in the Biophysical Properties of the Cell Membrane Are Involved in the Response of Neurospora crassa to Staurosporine.,"Neurospora crassa is a non-pathogenic filamentous fungus widely used as a multicellular eukaryotic model. Recently, the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane of N. crassa conidia were thoroughly characterized. They evolve during conidial germination at a speed that depends on culture conditions, suggesting an important association between membrane remodeling and the intense membrane biogenesis that takes place during the germinative process. Staurosporine (STS) is a drug used to induce programmed cell death in various organisms. In N. crassa, STS up-regulates the expression of the ABC transporter ABC-3, which localizes at the plasma membrane and pumps STS out. To understand the role of plasma membrane biophysical properties in the fungal drug response, N. crassa was subjected to STS treatment during early and late conidial development stages. Following 1 h treatment with STS, there is an increase in the abundance of the more ordered, sphingolipid-enriched, domains in the plasma membrane of conidia. This leads to higher fluidity in other membrane regions. The global order of the membrane remains thus practically unchanged. Significant changes in sphingolipid-enriched domains were also observed after 15 min challenge with STS, but they were essentially opposite to those verified for the 1 h treatment, suggesting different types of drug responses. STS effects on membrane properties that are more dependent on ergosterol levels also depend on the developmental stage. There were no alterations on 2 h-grown cells, clearly contrasting to what happens at longer growth times. In this case, the differences were more marked for longer STS treatment, and rationalized considering that the drug prevents the increase in the ergosterol/glycerophospholipid ratio that normally takes place at the late conidial stage/transition to the mycelial stage. This could be perceived as a drug-induced development arrest after 5 h growth, involving ergosterol, and pointing to a role of lipid rafts possibly related with an up-regulated expression of the ABC-3 transporter. Overall, our results suggest the involvement of membrane ordered domains in the response mechanisms to STS in N. crassa.","['antifungal drug', 'biophysical properties', 'conidial development', 'ergosterol', 'fluorescence spectroscopy', 'liposomes', 'plasma membrane', 'sphingolipid domains']",Frontiers in physiology,Portugal,2018
24581151,"Transcriptional comparison of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa growing on three major monosaccharides D-glucose, D-xylose and L-arabinose.","BACKGROUND: D-glucose, D-xylose and L-arabinose are the three major monosaccharides in plant cell walls. Complete utilization of all three sugars is still a bottleneck for second-generation cellulolytic bioethanol production, especially for L-arabinose. However, little is known about gene expression profiles during L-arabinose utilization in fungi and a comparison of the genome-wide fungal response to these three major monosaccharides has not yet been reported. RESULTS: Using next-generation sequencing technology, we have analyzed the transcriptome of N. crassa grown on L-arabinose versus D-xylose, with D-glucose as the reference. We found that the gene expression profiles on L-arabinose were dramatically different from those on D-xylose. It appears that L-arabinose can rewire the fungal cell metabolic pathway widely and provoke the expression of many kinds of sugar transporters, hemicellulase genes and transcription factors. In contrast, many fewer genes, mainly related to the pentose metabolic pathway, were upregulated on D-xylose. The rewired metabolic response to L-arabinose was significantly different and wider than that under no carbon conditions, although the carbon starvation response was initiated on L-arabinose. Three novel sugar transporters were identified and characterized for their substrates here, including one glucose transporter GLT-1 (NCU01633) and two novel pentose transporters, XAT-1 (NCU01132), XYT-1 (NCU05627). One transcription factor associated with the regulation of hemicellulase genes, HCR-1 (NCU05064) was also characterized in the present study. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted the first transcriptome analysis of Neurospora crassa grown on L-arabinose and performed a comparative analysis with cells grown on D-xylose and D-glucose, which deepens the understanding of the utilization of L-arabinose and D-xylose in filamentous fungi. The dataset generated by this research will be useful for mining target genes for D-xylose and L-arabinose utilization engineering and the novel sugar transportes identified are good targets for pentose untilization and biofuels production. Moreover, hemicellulase production by fungi could be improved by modifying the hemicellulase regulator discovered here.",?,Biotechnology for biofuels,China. tian_cg@tib.cas.cn,2014 Feb 28
29738831,Histone variant H2A.Z antagonizes the positive effect of the transcriptional activator CPC1 to regulate catalase-3 expression under normal and oxidative stress conditions.,"In eukaryotes, deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z into nucleosomes through the chromatin remodeling complex, SWR1, is a crucial step in modulating gene transcription. Recently, H2A.Z has been shown to control the expression of responsive genes, but the underlying mechanism of how H2A.Z responds to physiological stimuli is not well understood. Here, we reveal that, in Neurospora crassa, H2A.Z is a negative regulator of catalase-3 gene, which is responsible for resistance to oxidative stress. H2A.Z represses cat-3 gene expression through direct incorporation at cat-3 locus in a SWR1 complex dependent pathway. Notably, loss of H2A.Z or SWR1 subunits leads to increased binding of a transcription factor, CPC1, at cat-3 locus. Additionally, introduction of plasmids containing gene encoding H2A.Z or SWR1 complex subunits into wild-type strains decreased CAT-3 expression, indicating that H2A.Z counteracts the positive effect of CPC1 to achieve low level cat-3 expression under non-inductive condition. Furthermore, upon oxidative stress, H2A.Z is rapidly evicted from cat-3 locus for the recruitment of CPC1, resulting in robust and full cat-3 gene expression in response to external stimuli. Collectively, this study strongly demonstrates that H2A.Z antagonizes the function of transcription factor to regulate responsive gene transcription under normal conditions and to poise for gene full activation under oxidative stress.","['Catalase-3', 'Gene regulation', 'H2A.Z', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Oxidative stress']",Free radical biology & medicine,China,2018 Jun
24277852,Suppression of WC-independent frequency transcription by RCO-1 is essential for Neurospora circadian clock.,"Rhythmic activation and repression of clock gene transcription is essential for the functions of eukaryotic circadian clocks. In the Neurospora circadian oscillator, frequency (frq) transcription requires the WHITE COLLAR (WC) complex. Here, we show that the transcriptional corepressor regulation of conidiation-1 (RCO-1) is essential for clock function by regulating frq transcription. In rco-1 mutants, both overt and molecular rhythms are abolished, frq mRNA levels are constantly high, and WC binding to the frq promoter is dramatically reduced. Surprisingly, frq mRNA levels were constantly high in the rco-1 wc double mutants, indicating that RCO-1 suppresses WC-independent transcription and promotes WC complex binding to the frq promoter. Furthermore, RCO-1 is required for maintaining normal chromatin structure at the frq locus. Deletion of H3K36 methyltransferase su(var)3-9-enhancer-of-zeste-trithorax-2 (SET-2) or the chromatin remodeling factor CHD-1 leads to WC-independent frq transcription and loss of overt rhythms. Together, our results uncover a previously unexpected regulatory mechanism for clock gene transcription.","['H3K36me3', 'RCO-1/Tup1', 'clock gene frq', 'transcriptional repression']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,China,2013 Dec 10
25288950,Phylogenetics and Gene Structure Dynamics of Polygalacturonase Genes in Aspergillus and Neurospora crassa.,"Polygalacturonase (PG) gene is a typical gene family present in eukaryotes. Forty-nine PGs were mined from the genomes of Neurospora crassa and five Aspergillus species. The PGs were classified into 3 clades such as clade 1 for rhamno-PGs, clade 2 for exo-PGs and clade 3 for exo- and endo-PGs, which were further grouped into 13 sub-clades based on the polypeptide sequence similarity. In gene structure analysis, a total of 124 introns were present in 44 genes and five genes lacked introns to give an average of 2.5 introns per gene. Intron phase distribution was 64.5% for phase 0, 21.8% for phase 1, and 13.7% for phase 2, respectively. The introns varied in their sequences and their lengths ranged from 20 bp to 424 bp with an average of 65.9 bp, which is approximately half the size of introns in other fungal genes. There were 29 homologous intron blocks and 26 of those were sub-clade specific. Intron losses were counted in 18 introns in which no obvious phase preference for intron loss was observed. Eighteen introns were placed at novel positions, which is considerably higher than those of plant PGs. In an evolutionary sense both intron loss and gain must have taken place for shaping the current PGs in these fungi. Together with the small intron size, low conservation of homologous intron blocks and higher number of novel introns, PGs of fungal species seem to have recently undergone highly dynamic evolution.","['Aspergillus', 'Neuorospora', 'gene structure', 'intron loss/gain', 'intron phase', 'polygalacturonase']",The plant pathology journal,Korea,2013 Sep
33199382,Fungal Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) Transcription Factor ADS-1 Regulates Drug Efflux and Ergosterol Metabolism under Antifungal Azole Stress.,"Antifungal azoles are the most widely used antifungal drugs in clinical and agricultural practice. Fungi can mount adaptive responses to azole stress by modifying the transcript levels of many genes, and the responsive mechanisms to azoles are the basis for fungi to develop azole resistance. In this study, we identified a new Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) transcription factor, ADS-1, with a positive regulatory function in transcriptional responses to azole stress in the model filamentous fungal species Neurospora crassa Under ketoconazole (KTC) stress, the ads-1 transcript level was significantly increased in N. crassa Deletion of ads-1 increased susceptibility to different azoles, while its overexpression increased resistance to these azoles. The cdr4 gene, which encodes the key azole efflux pump, was positively regulated by ADS-1. Deletion of ads-1 reduced the transcriptional response by cdr4 to KTC stress and increased cellular KTC accumulation under KTC stress, while ads-1 overexpression had the opposite effect. ADS-1 also positively regulated the transcriptional response by erg11, which encodes the azole target lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase for ergosterol biosynthesis, to KTC stress. After KTC treatment, the ads-1 deletion mutant had less ergosterol but accumulated more lanosterol than the wild type, while ads-1 overexpression had the opposite effect. Homologs of ADS-1 are widely present in filamentous fungal species of Ascomycota but not in yeasts. Deletion of the gene encoding an ADS-1 homolog in Aspergillus flavus also increased susceptibility to KTC and itraconazole (ITZ). Besides, deletion of A. flavusads-1 (Afads-1) significantly reduced the transcriptional responses by genes encoding homologs of CDR4 and ERG11 in A. flavus to KTC stress, and the deletion mutant accumulated more KTC but less ergosterol. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the function and regulatory mechanism of ADS-1 homologs among different fungal species in azole responses and the basal resistance of azoles are highly conserved.","['Aspergillus flavus', 'Neurospora crassa', 'antifungal drug', 'azole', 'drug resistance', 'transcription factor']",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,China,2021 Jan 20

The zenc gene is 888-bp in length, encoding a 295-residue polypeptide. Purified ZENC has maximal activity at pH 8.0 and 45  degrees C, and is highly stable at pH 6.0-8.0 for 1 h at 37  degrees C. The activity of the secreted enzyme in shaken-flask fermentation was 40.0 U/ml.

We applied the enzyme into three different kinds of animal feed. On addition of ZENC (800 U) to distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), maize by-products and corn bran (25 g), the concentration of zearalenone was reduced by 70.9%, 88.9% and 94.7% respectively.

36922001,Chromatin structure influences rate and spectrum of spontaneous mutations in Neurospora crassa.,"Although mutation rates have been extensively studied, variation in mutation rates throughout the genome is poorly understood. To understand patterns of genetic variation, it is important to understand how mutation rates vary. Chromatin modifications may be an important factor in determining variation in mutation rates in eukaryotic genomes. To study variation in mutation rates, we performed a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa and sequenced the genomes of the 40 MA lines that had been propagated asexually for approximately 1015 [1003, 1026] mitoses. We detected 1322 mutations in total and observed that the mutation rate was higher in regions of low GC, in domains of H3K9 trimethylation, in centromeric regions, and in domains of H3K27 trimethylation. The rate of single-nucleotide mutations in euchromatin was 2.46 [2.19, 2.77] x 10(-10) In contrast, the mutation rate in H3K9me3 domains was 10-fold higher: 2.43 [2.25, 2.62] x 10(-9) We also observed that the spectrum of single-nucleotide mutations was different between H3K9me3 and euchromatic domains. Our statistical model of mutation rate variation predicted a moderate amount of extant genetic variation, suggesting that the mutation rate is an important factor in determining levels of natural genetic variation. Furthermore, we characterized mutation rates of structural variants, complex mutations, and the effect of local sequence context on the mutation rate. Our study highlights that chromatin modifications are associated with mutation rates, and accurate evolutionary inferences should take variation in mutation rates across the genome into account.",?,Genome research,Finland,2023 Mar 15

Stimulated by a systematic effort to collect wild strains initiated by Stanford geneticist David Perkins, the genus Neurospora has also become a basic model for the study of evolutionary processes, speciation, and population biology. In this chapter, we will first trace the history that brought Neurospora into the era of population genomics. We will then cover the major contributions of population genomic investigations using Neurospora to our understanding of microbial biogeography and speciation, and review recent work using population genomics and genome-wide association mapping that illustrates the unique potential of Neurospora as a model for identifying the genetic basis of (potentially adaptive) phenotypes in filamentous fungi. The advent of population genomics has contributed to firmly establish Neurospora as a complete model system and we hope our review will entice biologists to include Neurospora in their research.","['Ascomycete', 'Biogeography', 'Filamentous fungi', 'Introgression', 'Population genomics', 'Reverse ecology', 'Selective sweep', 'Self-nonself recognition', 'Speciation']","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",France. pierre.gladieux@inra.fr,2020
31649638,"The Genetics and Biochemistry of Cell Wall Structure and Synthesis in Neurospora crassa, a Model Filamentous Fungus.","This review discusses the wealth of information available for the N. crassa cell wall. The basic organization and structure of the cell wall is presented and how the wall changes during the N. crassa life cycle is discussed. Over forty cell wall glycoproteins have been identified by proteomic analyses. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified many of the key enzymes needed for cell wall biogenesis, and the roles these enzymes play in cell wall biogenesis are discussed. The review includes a discussion of how the major cell wall components (chitin, beta-1,3-glucan, mixed beta-1,3-/ beta-1,4- glucans, glycoproteins, and melanin) are synthesized and incorporated into the cell wall. We present a four-step model for how cell wall glycoproteins are covalently incorporated into the cell wall. In N. crassa, the covalent incorporation of cell wall glycoproteins into the wall occurs through a glycosidic linkage between lichenin (a mixed beta-1,3-/beta-1,4- glucan) and a ""processed"" galactomannan that has been attached to the glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharides. The first step is the addition of the galactomannan to the N-linked oligosaccharide. Mutants affected in galactomannan formation are unable to incorporate glycoproteins into their cell walls. The second step is carried out by the enzymes from the GH76 family of alpha-1,6-mannanases, which cleave the galactomannan to generate a processed galactomannan. The model suggests that the third and fourth steps are carried out by members of the GH72 family of glucanosyltransferases. In the third step the glucanosyltransferases cleave lichenin and generate enzyme/substrate intermediates in which the lichenin is covalently attached to the active site of the glucanosyltransferases. In the final step, the glucanosyltransferases attach the lichenin onto the processed galactomannans, which creates new glycosidic bonds and effectively incorporates the glycoproteins into the cross-linked cell wall glucan/chitin matrix.","['Neurospora', 'cell wall', 'filamentous fungi', 'galactomannan', 'glucan', 'glucanosyltransferase', 'mannanase', 'melanin']",Frontiers in microbiology,United States,2019
36294641,"Regulator of G Protein Signaling Proteins Control Growth, Development and Cellulase Production in Neurospora crassa.","Heterotrimeric (alphabetagamma) G protein signaling pathways are critical environmental sensing systems found in eukaryotic cells. Exchange of GDP for GTP on the Galpha subunit leads to its activation. In contrast, GTP hydrolysis on the Galpha is accelerated by Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins, resulting in a return to the GDP-bound, inactive state. Here, we analyzed growth, development and extracellular cellulase production in strains with knockout mutations in the seven identified RGS genes (rgs-1 to rgs-7) in the filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa. We compared phenotypes to those of strains with either knockout mutations or expressing predicted constitutively activated, GTPase-deficient alleles for each of the three Galpha subunit genes (gna-1(Q204L), gna-2(Q205L) or gna-3(Q208L)). Our data revealed that six RGS mutants have taller aerial hyphae than wild type and all seven mutants exhibit reduced asexual sporulation, phenotypes shared with strains expressing the gna-1(Q204L) or gna-3(Q208L) allele. In contrast, Deltargs-1 and Deltargs-3 were the only RGS mutants with a slower growth rate phenotype, a defect in common with gna-1(Q204L) strains. With respect to female sexual development, Deltargs-1 possessed defects most similar to gna-3(Q208L) strains, while those of Deltargs-2 mutants resembled strains expressing the gna-1(Q204L) allele. Finally, we observed that four of the seven RGS mutants had significantly different extracellular cellulase levels relative to wild type. Of interest, the Deltargs-2 mutant had no detectable activity, similar to the gna-3(Q208L) strain. In contrast, the Deltargs-1 and Deltargs-4 mutants and gna-1(Q204L) and gna-2(Q205L) strains exhibited significantly higher cellulase activity than wild type. With the exception of sexual development, our results demonstrate the greatest number of genetic interactions between rgs-1 and gna-1 and rgs-2 and gna-3 in N. crassa.","['Neurospora', 'cellulase activity', 'filamentous fungi', 'genetic epistasis', 'heterotrimeric G protein signaling', 'regulator of G protein signaling']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",USA,2022 Oct 13
36876962,Antisense Transcription of the Neurospora Frequency Gene Is Rhythmically Regulated by CSP-1 Repressor but Dispensable for Clock Function.,"The circadian clock of Neurospora crassa is based on a negative transcriptional/translational feedback loops. The frequency (frq) gene controls the morning-specific rhythmic transcription of a sense RNA encoding FRQ, the negative element of the core circadian feedback loop. In addition, a long noncoding antisense RNA, qrf, is rhythmically transcribed in an evening-specific manner. It has been reported that the qrf rhythm relies on transcriptional interference with frq transcription and that complete suppression of qrf transcription impairs the circadian clock. We show here that qrf transcription is dispensable for circadian clock function. Rather, the evening-specific transcriptional rhythm of qrf is mediated by the morning-specific repressor CSP-1. Since CSP-1 expression is induced by light and glucose, this suggests a rhythmic coordination of qrf transcription with metabolism. However, a possible physiological significance for the circadian clock remains unclear, as suitable assays are not available.","['CSP-1', 'Neurospora', 'antisense RNA', 'circadian clock', 'frequency', 'glucose metabolism']",Journal of biological rhythms,Germany,2023 Mar 1
24794411,Analysis of the antimicrobial effects of nonthermal plasma on fungal spores in ionic solutions.,"The antimicrobial efficiency of reactive species-based control strategies is significantly affected by the dynamics of reactive species in the biological environment. Atmospheric-pressure nonthermal plasma is an ionized gas in which various reactive species are produced. The various levels of antimicrobial activity may result from the dynamic interaction of the plasma-generated reactive species with the environment. However, the nature of the interaction between plasma and environments is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the influence of the ionic strength of surrounding solutions (environment) on the antimicrobial activity of plasma in relation to the plasma-generated reactive species using a model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa. Our data revealed that the presence of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the background solution attenuated the deleterious effects of plasma on germination, internal structure, and genomic DNA of fungal spores. The protective effects of NaCl were not explained exclusively by pH, osmotic stability, or the level of reactive species in the solution. These were strongly associated with the ionic strength of the background solution. The presence of ions reduced plasma toxicity, which might be due to a reduced access of reactive species to fungal spores, and fungal spores were inactivated by plasma in a background fluid of nonionic osmolytes despite the low level of reactive species. Our results suggest that the surrounding environment may affect the behavior of reactive species, which leads to different biological consequences regardless of their quantity. Moreover, the microbicidal effect of plasma can be synergistically regulated through control of the microenvironment.","['Filamentous fungus', 'Free radicals', 'Ionic strength', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Plasma toxicity', 'Reactive species']",Free radical biology & medicine,Korea,2014 Jul
36142717,Extended N-Terminal Acetyltransferase Naa50 in Filamentous Fungi Adds to Naa50 Diversity.,"Most eukaryotic proteins are N-terminally acetylated by a set of Nalpha acetyltransferases (NATs). This ancient and ubiquitous modification plays a fundamental role in protein homeostasis, while mutations are linked to human diseases and phenotypic defects. In particular, Naa50 features species-specific differences, as it is inactive in yeast but active in higher eukaryotes. Together with NatA, it engages in NatE complex formation for cotranslational acetylation. Here, we report Naa50 homologs from the filamentous fungi Chaetomium thermophilum and Neurospora crassa with significant N- and C-terminal extensions to the conserved GNAT domain. Structural and biochemical analyses show that CtNaa50 shares the GNAT structure and substrate specificity with other homologs. However, in contrast to previously analyzed Naa50 proteins, it does not form NatE. The elongated N-terminus increases Naa50 thermostability and binds to dynein light chain protein 1, while our data suggest that conserved positive patches in the C-terminus allow for ribosome binding independent of NatA. Our study provides new insights into the many facets of Naa50 and highlights the diversification of NATs during evolution.","['Chaetomium thermophilum', 'GNAT domain', 'N-terminal acetyltransferase', 'NAT', 'Naa50', 'NatE', 'Neurospora crassa', 'X-ray structure', 'dynein light chain protein 1', 'ribosome association']",International journal of molecular sciences,Germany,2022 Sep 16
32158501,The H(2)O(2)-dependent activity of a fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase investigated with a turbidimetric assay.,"BACKGROUND: Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-dependent redox enzymes that cleave recalcitrant biopolymers such as cellulose, chitin, starch and hemicelluloses. Although LPMOs receive ample interest in industry and academia, their reaction mechanism is not yet fully understood. Recent studies showed that H(2)O(2) is a more efficient cosubstrate for the enzyme than O(2), which could greatly affect the utilization of LPMOs in industrial settings. RESULTS: We probe the reactivity of LPMO9C from the cellulose-degrading fungus Neurospora crassa with a turbidimetric assay using phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose (PASC) as substrate and H(2)O(2) as a cosubstrate. The measurements were also followed by continuous electrochemical H(2)O(2) detection and LPMO reaction products were analysed by mass spectrometry. Different systems for the in situ generation of H(2)O(2) and for the reduction of LPMO's active-site copper were employed, including glucose oxidase, cellobiose dehydrogenase, and the routinely used reductant ascorbate. CONCLUSIONS: We found for all systems that the supply of H(2)O(2) limited LPMO's cellulose depolymerization activity, which supports the function of H(2)O(2) as the relevant cosubstrate. The turbidimetric assay allowed rapid determination of LPMO activity on a cellulosic substrate without the need for time-consuming and instrumentally elaborate analysis methods.","['Cellobiose dehydrogenase', 'Cellulose', 'Glucose oxidase', 'Hydrogen peroxide', 'Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'Neurospora crassa']",Biotechnology for biofuels,Czech Republic.

In Neurospora crassa the main cell wall components, beta-1,3-glucan and chitin, are synthesized by enzymes conveyed by specialized vesicles to the hyphal tip. These vesicles follow different secretory routes, which are delicately coordinated by cargo-specific Rab GTPases until their accumulation at the Spitzenkorper. From there, the exocyst mediates the docking of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, where they ultimately get fused. Although significant progress has been done on the cellular mechanisms that carry cell wall synthesizing enzymes from the endoplasmic reticulum to hyphal tips, a lot of information is still missing.

33937222,L-Carnitine Production Through Biosensor-Guided Construction of the Neurospora crassa Biosynthesis Pathway in Escherichia coli.,"L-Carnitine is a bioactive compound derived from L-lysine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is closely associated with the transport of long-chain fatty acids in the intermediary metabolism of eukaryotes and sought after in the pharmaceutical, food, and feed industries. The L-carnitine biosynthesis pathway has not been observed in prokaryotes, and the use of eukaryotic microorganisms as natural L-carnitine producers lacks economic viability due to complex cultivation and low titers. While biotransformation processes based on petrochemical achiral precursors have been described for bacterial hosts, fermentative de novo synthesis has not been established although it holds the potential for a sustainable and economical one-pot process using renewable feedstocks. This study describes the metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for L-carnitine production. L-carnitine biosynthesis enzymes from the fungus Neurospora crassa that were functionally active in E. coli were identified and applied individually or in cascades to assemble and optimize a four-step L-carnitine biosynthesis pathway in this host. Pathway performance was monitored by a transcription factor-based L-carnitine biosensor. The engineered E. coli strain produced L-carnitine from supplemented L-N (epsilon)-trimethyllysine in a whole cell biotransformation, resulting in 15.9 muM carnitine found in the supernatant. Notably, this strain also produced 1.7 muM L-carnitine de novo from glycerol and ammonium as carbon and nitrogen sources through endogenous N (epsilon)-trimethyllysine. This work provides a proof of concept for the de novo L-carnitine production in E. coli, which does not depend on petrochemical synthesis of achiral precursors, but makes use of renewable feedstocks instead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of L-carnitine de novo synthesis using an engineered bacterium.","['biosensor', 'biosynthesis', 'biosynthetic cascade', 'carnitine', 'metabolic engineering', 'trimethyllysine']",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,Germany,2021
30028876,Light induces oxidative damage and protein stability in the fungal photoreceptor Vivid.,"Flavin-binding photoreceptor proteins sense blue-light (BL) in diverse organisms and have become core elements in recent optogenetic applications. The light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) protein Vivid (VVD) from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a classic BL photoreceptor, characterized by effecting a photocycle based on light-driven formation and subsequent spontaneous decay of a flavin-cysteinyl adduct. Here we report that VVD presents alternative outcomes to light exposure that result in protein self-oxidation and, unexpectedly, rise of stability through kinetic control. Using optical absorbance and mass spectrometry we show that purified VVD develops amorphous aggregates with the presence of oxidized residues located at the cofactor binding pocket. Light exposure increases oxidative levels in VVD and specific probe analysis identifies singlet oxygen production by the flavin. These results indicate that VVD acts alternatively as a photosensitizer, inducing self-oxidative damage and subsequent aggregation. Surprisingly, BL illumination has an additional, opposite effect in VVD. We show that light-induced adduct formation establishes a stable state, delaying protein aggregation until photoadduct decay occurs. In accordance, repeated BL illumination suppresses VVD aggregation altogether. Furthermore, photoadduct formation confers VVD stability against chemical denaturation. Analysis of the aggregation kinetics and testing of stabilizers against aggregation reveal that aggregation in VVD proceeds through light-dependent kinetic control and dimer formation. These results uncover the aggregation pathway of a photosensor, where light induces a remarkable interplay between protein damage and stability.",?,PloS one,Mexico,2018
29404209,Development of an RNA interference (RNAi) gene knockdown protocol in the anaerobic gut fungus Pecoramyces ruminantium strain C1A.,"Members of the anaerobic gut fungi (AGF) reside in rumen, hindgut, and feces of ruminant and non-ruminant herbivorous mammals and reptilian herbivores. No protocols for gene insertion, deletion, silencing, or mutation are currently available for the AGF, rendering gene-targeted molecular biological manipulations unfeasible. Here, we developed and optimized an RNA interference (RNAi)-based protocol for targeted gene silencing in the anaerobic gut fungus Pecoramyces ruminantium strain C1A. Analysis of the C1A genome identified genes encoding enzymes required for RNA silencing in fungi (Dicer, Argonaute, Neurospora crassa QDE-3 homolog DNA helicase, Argonaute-interacting protein, and Neurospora crassa QIP homolog exonuclease); and the competency of C1A germinating spores for RNA uptake was confirmed using fluorescently labeled small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Addition of chemically-synthesized siRNAs targeting D-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhD) gene to C1A germinating spores resulted in marked target gene silencing; as evident by significantly lower ldhD transcriptional levels, a marked reduction in the D-LDH specific enzymatic activity in intracellular protein extracts, and a reduction in D-lactate levels accumulating in the culture supernatant. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of untreated versus siRNA-treated cultures identified a few off-target siRNA-mediated gene silencing effects. As well, significant differential up-regulation of the gene encoding NAD-dependent 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (Pfam00389) in siRNA-treated C1A cultures was observed, which could possibly compensate for loss of D-LDH as an electron sink mechanism in C1A. The results demonstrate the feasibility of RNAi in anaerobic fungi, and opens the door for gene silencing-based studies in this fungal clade.","['Anaerobic gut fungi', 'D-lactate dehydrogenase', 'Pecoramyces ruminantium', 'RNA interference']",PeerJ,USA,2018
26004627,Involvement of mitochondrial proteins in calcium signaling and cell death induced by staurosporine in Neurospora crassa.,"Staurosporine-induced cell death in Neurospora crassa includes a well defined sequence of alterations in cytosolic calcium levels, comprising extracellular Ca(2+) influx and mobilization of Ca(2+) from internal stores. Here, we show that cells undergoing respiratory stress due to the lack of certain components of the mitochondrial complex I (like the 51kDa and 14kDa subunits) or the Ca(2+)-binding alternative NADPH dehydrogenase NDE-1 are hypersensitive to staurosporine and incapable of setting up a proper intracellular Ca(2+) response. Cells expressing mutant forms of NUO51 that mimic human metabolic diseases also presented Ca(2+) signaling deficiencies. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species is increased in cells lacking NDE-1 and seems to be required for Ca(2+) oscillations in response to staurosporine. Measurement of the mitochondrial levels of Ca(2+) further supported the involvement of these organelles in staurosporine-induced Ca(2+) signaling. In summary, our data indicate that staurosporine-induced fungal cell death involves a sophisticated response linking Ca(2+) dynamics and bioenergetics.","['Alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenase', 'Ca(2+) dynamics', 'Cell death', 'Complex I', 'Mitochondrion', 'NDE-1']",Biochimica et biophysica acta,Portugal.

27681634,Dual chromatin recognition by the histone deacetylase complex HCHC is required for proper DNA methylation in Neurospora crassa.,"DNA methylation, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, histone deacetylation, and highly repeated sequences are prototypical heterochromatic features, but their interrelationships are not fully understood. Prior work showed that H3K9 methylation directs DNA methylation and histone deacetylation via HP1 in Neurospora crassa and that the histone deacetylase complex HCHC is required for proper DNA methylation. The complex consists of the chromodomain proteins HP1 and chromodomain protein 2 (CDP-2), the histone deacetylase HDA-1, and the AT-hook motif protein CDP-2/HDA-1-associated protein (CHAP). We show that the complex is required for proper chromosome segregation, dissect its function, and characterize interactions among its components. Our analyses revealed the existence of an HP1-based DNA methylation pathway independent of its chromodomain. The pathway partially depends on CHAP but not on the CDP-2 chromodomain. CDP-2 serves as a bridge between the recognition of H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by HP1 and the histone deacetylase activity of HDA-1. CHAP is also critical for HDA-1 localization to heterochromatin. Specifically, the CHAP zinc finger interacts directly with the HDA-1 argonaute-binding protein 2 (Arb2) domain, and the CHAP AT-hook motifs recognize heterochromatic regions by binding to AT-rich DNA. Our data shed light on the interrelationships among the prototypical heterochromatic features and support a model in which dual recognition by the HP1 chromodomain and the CHAP AT-hooks are required for proper heterochromatin formation.","['DNA methylation', 'H3K9 methylation', 'HP1', 'heterochromatin', 'histone deacetylation']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Japan,2016 Oct 11
32514307,Configuration of active site segments in lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases steers oxidative xyloglucan degradation.,"BACKGROUND: Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are powerful enzymes that oxidatively cleave plant cell wall polysaccharides. LPMOs classified as fungal Auxiliary Activities family 9 (AA9) have been mainly studied for their activity towards cellulose; however, various members of this AA9 family have been also shown to oxidatively cleave hemicelluloses, in particularly xyloglucan (XG). So far, it has not been studied in detail how various AA9 LPMOs act in XG degradation, and in particular, how the mode-of-action relates to the structural configuration of these LPMOs. RESULTS: Two Neurospora crassa (Nc) LPMOs were found to represent different mode-of-action towards XG. Interestingly, the configuration of active site segments of these LPMOs differed as well, with a shorter Segment 1 ((-)Seg1) and a longer Segment 2 ((+)Seg2) present in NcLPMO9C and the opposite for NcLPMO9M ((+)Seg1(-)Seg2). We confirmed that NcLPMO9C cleaved the non-reducing end of unbranched glucosyl residues within XG via the oxidation of the C4-carbon. In contrast, we found that the oxidative cleavage of the XG backbone by NcLPMO9M occurred next to both unbranched and substituted glucosyl residues. The latter are decorated with xylosyl, xylosyl-galactosyl and xylosyl-galactosyl-fucosyl units. The relationship between active site segments and the mode-of-action of these NcLPMOs was rationalized by a structure-based phylogenetic analysis of fungal AA9 LPMOs. LPMOs with a (-)Seg1(+)Seg2 configuration clustered together and appear to have a similar XG substitution-intolerant cleavage pattern. LPMOs with the (+)Seg1(-)Seg2 configuration also clustered together and are reported to display a XG substitution-tolerant cleavage pattern. A third cluster contained LPMOs with a (-)Seg1(-)Seg2 configuration and no oxidative XG activity. CONCLUSIONS: The detailed characterization of XG degradation products released by LPMOs reveal a correlation between the configuration of active site segments and mode-of-action of LPMOs. In particular, oxidative XG-active LPMOs, which are tolerant and intolerant to XG substitutions are structurally and phylogenetically distinguished from XG-inactive LPMOs. This study contributes to a better understanding of the structure-function relationship of AA9 LPMOs.","['AA9 LPMO', 'Active site segments', 'Biomass', 'Biorefinery', 'Hemicellulose', 'Lignocellulose', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Plant cell wall', 'Xyloglucan']",Biotechnology for biofuels,The Netherlands.

30143790,Effects of acclimation time and epigenetic mechanisms on growth of Neurospora in fluctuating environments.,"Reaction norms or tolerance curves have often been used to predict how organisms deal with fluctuating environments. A potential drawback is that reaction norms measured in different constant environments may not capture all aspects of organismal responses to fluctuating environments. We examined growth of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa in fluctuating temperatures and tested if growth in fluctuating temperatures can be explained simply by the growth in different constant temperatures or if more complex models are needed. In addition, as previous studies on fluctuating environments have revealed that past temperatures that organisms have experienced can affect their response to current temperature, we tested the roles of different epigenetic mechanisms in response to fluctuating environments using different mutants. We found that growth of Neurospora can be predicted in fluctuating temperatures to some extent if acclimation times are taken into account in the model. Interestingly, while fluctuating environments have been linked with epigenetic responses, we found only some evidence of involvement of epigenetic mechanisms on tolerating fluctuating temperatures. Mutants which lacked H3K4 or H3K36 methylation had slightly impaired response to temperature fluctuations, in addition the H3K4 methylation mutant and a mutant in the RNA interference pathway had altered acclimation times.",?,Heredity,Finland. ilkka.kronholm@jyu.fi,2018 Oct
24848562,Dynamics of transcriptome evolution in the model eukaryote Neurospora.,"Mounting evidence indicates that changes in the transcriptome contribute significantly to the phenotypic differentiation of closely related species. Nonetheless, further genome-wide studies, spanning a broad range of organisms, are needed to decipher the factors driving transcriptome evolution. The model Neurospora (Ascomycota) comprises a simple system for empirically studying the evolutionary dynamics of the transcriptome. Here, we studied the evolution of gene expression in Neurospora crassa and Neurospora tetrasperma and show that patterns of transcriptome evolution are connected to genome evolution, tissue type and sexual identity (mating types, mat A and mat a) in these eukaryotes. Based on the comparisons of inter- and intraspecies expression divergence, our data reveal that rapid expression divergence is more apt to occur in sexual/female (SF) than vegetative/male (VM) tissues. In addition, interspecies gene expression and protein sequence divergence were strongly correlated for SF, but not VM, tissue. A correlation between transcriptome and protein evolution parallels findings from certain animals, but not yeast, and add support for the theory that expression evolution differs fundamentally among multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes. Finally, we found that sexual identity in these hermaphroditic Neurospora species is connected to interspecies expression divergence in a tissue-dependent manner: rapid divergence occurred for mat A- and mat a-biased genes from SF and VM tissues, respectively. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that rapid interspecies transcriptome evolution is shifting the mating types of Neurospora towards distinct female and male phenotypes, that is, sexual dimorphism.","['expression evolution', 'mating type', 'multicellularity', 'sexual identity', 'tissue type']",Journal of evolutionary biology,Sweden,2014 Jun
37043358,Conformational changes in the negative arm of the circadian clock correlate with dynamic interactomes involved in post-transcriptional regulation.,"Biology is tuned to the Earth's diurnal cycle by the circadian clock, a transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop that regulates physiology via transcriptional activation and other post-transcriptional mechanisms. We hypothesize that circadian post-transcriptional regulation might stem from conformational shifts in the intrinsically disordered proteins that comprise the negative arm of the feedback loop to coordinate variation in negative-arm-centered macromolecular complexes. This work demonstrates temporal conformational fluidity in the negative arm that correlates with 24-h variation in physiologically diverse macromolecular complex components in eukaryotic clock proteins. Short linear motifs on the negative-arm proteins that correspond with the interactors localized to disordered regions and known temporal phosphorylation sites suggesting changes in these macromolecular complexes could be due to conformational changes imparted by the temporal phospho-state. Interactors that oscillate in the macromolecular complexes over circadian time correlate with post-transcriptionally regulated proteins, highlighting how time-of-day variation in the negative-arm protein complexes may tune cellular physiology.","['CP: Genomics', 'CP: Molecular biology', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'FREQUENCY', 'Intrinsic Disorder', 'Neurospora crassa', 'PERIOD', 'interactome', 'negative arm proteins']",Cell reports,USA,2023 Apr 10
32313605,"Fungal social barriers: to fuse, or not to fuse, that is the question.","Cell fusion takes place in all domains of life and contributes greatly to the formation of complex multicellular structures. In particular, many fungi, such as the filamentous Neurospora crassa, rely on conspecific somatic cell fusion to drive the unicellular-to-multicellular transition and formation of the interconnected mycelial syncytium. This can, however, lead to the transmission of infectious elements and deleterious genotypes that have a negative impact on the organismal fitness. Accumulating evidence obtained from natural populations suggests that N. crassa has evolved various self/non-self or allorecognition systems to avoid fusion between genetically non-identical spores or hyphae at all costs. Here we present an overview of the recent advances made in the field of fungal allorecognition, describe its genetic basis, and comment on its evolutionary meaning.

31001214,Communicate and Fuse: How Filamentous Fungi Establish and Maintain an Interconnected Mycelial Network.,"Cell-to-cell communication and cell fusion are fundamental biological processes across the tree of life. Survival is often dependent upon being able to identify nearby individuals and respond appropriately. Communication between genetically different individuals allows for the identification of potential mating partners, symbionts, prey, or predators. In contrast, communication between genetically similar (or identical) individuals is important for mediating the development of multicellular organisms or for coordinating density-dependent behaviors (i.e., quorum sensing). This review describes the molecular and genetic mechanisms that mediate cell-to-cell communication and cell fusion between cells of Ascomycete filamentous fungi, with a focus on Neurospora crassa. Filamentous fungi exist as a multicellular, multinuclear network of hyphae, and communication-mediated cell fusion is an important aspect of colony development at each stage of the life cycle. Asexual spore germination occurs in a density-dependent manner. Germinated spores (germlings) avoid cells that are genetically different at specific loci, while chemotropically engaging with cells that share identity at these recognition loci. Germlings with genetic identity at recognition loci undergo cell fusion when in close proximity, a fitness attribute that contributes to more rapid colony establishment. Communication and cell fusion also occur between hyphae in a colony, which are important for reinforcing colony architecture and supporting the development of complex structures such as aerial hyphae and sexual reproductive structures. Over 70 genes have been identified in filamentous fungi (primarily N. crassa) that are involved in kind recognition, chemotropic interactions, and cell fusion. While the hypothetical signal(s) and receptor(s) remain to be described, a dynamic molecular signaling network that regulates cell-cell interactions has been revealed, including two conserved MAP-Kinase cascades, a conserved STRIPAK complex, transcription factors, a NOX complex involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species, cell-integrity sensors, actin, components of the secretory pathway, and several other proteins. Together these pathways facilitate the integration of extracellular signals, direct polarized growth, and initiate a transcriptional program that reinforces signaling and prepares cells for downstream processes, such as membrane merger, cell fusion and adaptation to heterokaryon formation.","['MAP kinase signaling', 'Neurospora', 'ROS signaling', 'STRIPAK', 'cell fusion', 'chemotropic interactions']",Frontiers in microbiology,United States,2019
35980572,The Q-system: A Versatile Repressible Binary Expression System.,"Binary expression systems are useful genetic tools for experimentally labeling or manipulating the function of defined cells. The Q-system is a repressible binary expression system that consists of a transcription factor QF (and the recently improved QF2/QF2(w)), the inhibitor QS, a QUAS-geneX effector, and a drug that inhibits QS (quinic acid). The Q-system can be used alone or in combination with other binary expression systems, such as GAL4/UAS and LexA/LexAop. In this review chapter, we discuss the past, present, and future of the Q-system for applications in Drosophila and other organisms. We discuss the in vivo application of the Q-system for transgenic labeling, the modular nature of QF that allows chimeric or split transcriptional activators to be developed, its temporal control by quinic acid, new methods to generate QF2 reagents, intersectional expression labeling, and its recent adoption into many emerging experimental species.","['Bioengineering', 'Chimeric transactivators', 'Drosophila', 'HACK', 'Mosquito', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Split-QF', 'Synthetic biology']","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",UK,2022
31216909,Circadian Rhythms in Fungi: Structure/Function/Evolution of Some Clock Components.,"The fungal clock, especially that in Neurospora crassa, is composed of several proteins, notably FRQ, WC-1, and WC-2, which interact at the protein level and at the level of transcription. It is shown here that regions of the FRQ that are highly conserved in many fungal species show significant similarity to regions of proteins found in the amoebae Capsaspora and Acanthamoebae. These 2 amoebae were specifically explored because they have been suggested, based on extensive evidence, to be related to precursors of the modern fungi. Those proteins in Capsaspora/Acanthamoebae with some similarity to FRQ are LARP (an RNA-binding protein), ARNT (which has a PAS motif), and heat shock factor (HSF). These regions of LARP and HSF that show similarity to FRQ are highly conserved between plants, animals, and amoeba. This suggests that these regions were present at the time of the divergence of plants, fungi, insects, and animals, and therefore, they could be plausible precursors to regions of the fungal FRQ. These particular regions of FRQ that show similarity to LARP and HSF are also of functional significance since mutations in these regions of the Neurospora FRQ led to changes in the rhythm. The FRQ proteins from 13 different species of fungi were analyzed via motif analysis (MEME), and 11 different motifs were found. This provides some understanding as to the minimum requirements for an FRQ protein. Many of these FRQ motifs can be matched up with known domains in FRQ. In addition, these 13 different species of fungi were screened for the presence/absence of 7 additional genes/proteins that play some role in fungal clocks.","['FRQ', 'Neurospora', 'WC-1', 'evolution', 'fungi']",Journal of biological rhythms,San Diego,2019 Aug
36143373,Flammulina filiformis Pkac Gene Complementing in Neurospora crassa Mutant Reveals Its Function in Mycelial Growth and Abiotic Stress Response.,"Flammulina filiformis is a popular edible mushroom that easily suffers from heat and oxidative stresses. The cyclic adenylate-dependent protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway is the main signaling pathway in response to environmental stress, and the PKAC is the terminal catalytic subunit of this pathway. In this study, the Pkac gene was identified in F. filiformis, which was highly conserved in basidiomycetes and ascomycetes. The transcription analysis showed that the Pkac gene was involved in the mycelial growth and the fruiting body development of fungi. In Neurospora crassa, the Pkac gene deletion (DeltaPkac) resulted in the slower growth of the mycelia. We complemented the F. filiformis FfPkac to N. crassa DeltaPkac mutant to obtain the CPkac strain. The mycelial growth in the CPkac strain was restored to the same level as the WT strain. In addition, the FfPkac gene showed significantly up-regulated expression under heat and oxidative stresses. By analyzing the differentially expressed genes of DeltaPkac and Cpkac with WT, respectively, seven downstream genes regulated by Pkac were identified and may be related to mycelial growth. They were mainly focused on microbial metabolism in diverse environments, mitochondrial biogenesis, protein translation and nucleocytoplasmic transport. RT-qPCR results confirmed that the expression patterns of these seven genes were consistent with FfPkac under heat and oxidative stresses. The results revealed the conserved functions of PKAC in filamentous fungi and its regulatory mechanism in response to heat and oxidative stresses.","['allogenic gene complement', 'cAMP-dependent protein kinase', 'filamentous fungi', 'heat and oxidative stresses']","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",China,2022 Aug 28

To calculate diversity, we use the mean nearest neighbor distance of crosses plotted in trait space.

29563189,Cold Shock as a Screen for Genes Involved in Cold Acclimatization in Neurospora crassa.,"When subjected to rapid drops of temperature (cold shock), Neurospora responds with a temporary shift in its morphology. This report is the first to examine this response genetically. We report here the results of a screen of selected mutants from the Neurospora knockout library for alterations in their morphological response to cold shock. Three groups of knockouts were selected to be subject to this screen: genes previously suspected to be involved in hyphal development as well as knockouts resulting in morphological changes; transcription factors; and genes homologous to E. coli genes known to alter their expression in response to cold shock. A total of 344 knockout strains were subjected to cold shock. Of those, 118 strains were identified with altered responses. We report here the cold shock morphologies and GO categorizations of strains subjected to this screen. Of strains with knockouts in genes associated with hyphal growth or morphology, 33 of 131 tested (25%) showed an altered response to cold shock. Of strains with knockouts in transcription factor genes, 30 of 145 (20%) showed an altered response to cold shock. Of strains with knockouts in genes homologous to E. coli genes which display altered levels of transcription in response to cold shock, a total of 55 of 68 tested (81%) showed an altered cold shock response.

34718549,Impact of bacterial volatiles on phytopathogenic fungi: an in vitro study on microbial competition and interaction.,"Microorganisms in the rhizosphere are abundant and exist in very high taxonomic diversity. The major players are bacteria and fungi, and bacteria have evolved many strategies to prevail over fungi, among them harmful enzyme activities and noxious secondary metabolites. Interactions between plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and phytopathogenic fungi are potentially valuable since the plant would benefit from fungal growth repression. In this respect, the role of volatile bacterial metabolites in fungistasis has been demonstrated, but the mechanisms of action are less understood. We used three phytopathogenic fungal species (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Juxtiphoma eupyrena) as well as one non-phytopathogenic species (Neurospora crassa) and the plant growth promoting rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 in co-cultivation assays to investigate the influence of bacterial volatile metabolites on fungi on a cellular level. As a response to the treatment, we found elevated lipid peroxidation, which indirectly reflected the loss of fungal cell membrane integrity. An increase in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and laccase activities indicated oxidative stress. Acclimation to these adverse growth conditions completely restored fungal growth. One of the bioactive bacterial volatile compounds seemed to be ammonia, which was a component of the bacterial volatile mixture. Applied as a single compound in biogenic concentrations ammonia also caused an increase in lipid peroxidation and enzyme activities, but the extent and pattern did not fully match the effect of the entire bacterial volatile mixture.","['Juxtiphoma', 'Rhizoctonia', 'Sclerotinia', 'Serratia', 'Ammonia', 'bacterial volatile metabolites', 'oxidative stress', 'phytopathogenic fungi']",Journal of experimental botany,Germany,2022 Jan 13
33824861,"Prediction of Metabolite Concentrations, Rate Constants and Post-Translational Regulation Using Maximum Entropy-Based Simulations with Application to Central Metabolism of Neurospora crassa.","We report the application of a recently proposed approach for modeling biological systems using a maximum entropy production rate principle in lieu of having in vivo rate constants. The method is applied in four steps: (1) a new ordinary differential equation (ODE) based optimization approach based on Marcelin's 1910 mass action equation is used to obtain the maximum entropy distribution; (2) the predicted metabolite concentrations are compared to those generally expected from experiments using a loss function from which post-translational regulation of enzymes is inferred; (3) the system is re-optimized with the inferred regulation from which rate constants are determined from the metabolite concentrations and reaction fluxes; and finally (4) a full ODE-based, mass action simulation with rate parameters and allosteric regulation is obtained. From the last step, the power characteristics and resistance of each reaction can be determined. The method is applied to the central metabolism of Neurospora crassa and the flow of material through the three competing pathways of upper glycolysis, the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway are evaluated as a function of the NADP/NADPH ratio. It is predicted that regulation of phosphofructokinase (PFK) and flow through the pentose phosphate pathway are essential for preventing an extreme level of fructose 1,6-bisphophate accumulation. Such an extreme level of fructose 1,6-bisphophate would otherwise result in a glassy cytoplasm with limited diffusion, dramatically decreasing the entropy and energy production rate and, consequently, biological competitiveness.","['mass action kinetics', 'maximum entropy production', 'metabolism', 'statistical thermodynamics']","Processes (Basel, Switzerland)",USA,2018 Jun
31474947,Neurospora crassa NADPH Oxidase NOX-1 Is Localized in the Vacuolar System and the Plasma Membrane.,"The NADPH oxidases (NOX) catalyze the production of superoxide by transferring electrons from NADPH to O(2), in a regulated manner. In Neurospora crassa NOX-1 is required for normal growth of hyphae, development of aerial mycelium and asexual spores, and it is essential for sexual differentiation and cell-cell fusion. Determining the subcellular localization of NOX-1 is a critical step in understanding the mechanisms by which this enzyme can regulate all these different processes. Using fully functional versions of NOX-1 tagged with mCherry, we show that in growing hyphae NOX-1 shows only a minor association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers Ca(2+)-ATPase NCA-1 and an ER lumen-targeted GFP. Likewise, NOX-1 shows minor co-localization with early endosomes labeled with YPT-52, a GTPase of the Rab5 family. In contrast, NOX-1 shows extensive co-localization with two independent markers of the entire vacuolar system; the vacuolar ATPase subunit VMA-1 and the fluorescent molecule carboxy-DFFDA. In addition, part of NOX-1 was detected at the plasma membrane. The NOX-1 regulatory subunit NOR-1 displays a very different pattern of localization, showing a fine granular distribution along the entire hypha and some accumulation at the hyphal tip. In older hyphal regions, germinating conidia, and conidiophores it forms larger and discrete puncta some of which appear localized at the plasma membrane and septa. Notably, co-localization of NOX-1 and NOR-1 was mainly observed under conidial cell-cell fusion conditions in discrete vesicular structures. NOX functions in fungi have been evaluated mainly in mutants that completely lacked this protein, also eliminating interactions between hyphal growth regulatory proteins NOR-1, the GTPase RAC-1 and the scaffold protein BEM-1. To dissect NOX-1 roles as scaffold and as ROS-producing enzyme, we analyzed the function of NOX-1::mCherry proteins carrying proline 382 by histidine (P382H) or cysteine 524 by arginine (C524R) substitutions, predicted to only affect NADPH-binding. Without notably affecting NOX-1 localization or protein levels, each of these substitutions resulted in lack of function phenotypes, indicating that NOX-1 multiple functions are all dependent on its oxidase activity. Our results open new interpretations to possible NOX functions, as components of the fungal vacuolar system and the plasma membrane, as well as to new vacuolar functions.","['CAT fusion', 'NOR-1', 'ROS', 'cell fusion', 'fungal development', 'fungal growth']",Frontiers in microbiology,Mexico,2019
29051754,A Cellular Fusion Cascade Regulated by LaeA Is Required for Sclerotial Development in Aspergillus flavus.,"Aspergillus flavus is a saprophytic soil fungus that poses a serious threat worldwide as it contaminates many food and feed crops with the carcinogenic mycotoxin called aflatoxin. This pathogen persists as sclerotia in the soil which enables fungal survival in harsh environmental conditions. Sclerotia formation by A. flavus depends on successful cell communication and hyphal fusion events. Loss of LaeA, a conserved developmental regulator in fungi, abolishes sclerotia formation in this species whereas overexpression (OE) of laeA results in enhanced sclerotia production. Here we demonstrate that sclerotia loss and inability to form heterokaryons in A. flavusDeltalaeA is mediated by homologs of the Neurospora crassa ham (hyphal anastomosis) genes termed hamE-I in A. flavus. LaeA positively regulates ham gene expression and deletion of hamF, G, H, or I phenocopies DeltalaeA as demonstrated by heterokaryon and sclerotia loss and reduced aflatoxin synthesis and virulence of these mutants. Deletion of hamE showed a less severe phenotype. hamE-I homologs are positively regulated by the clock controlled transcription factor ADV-1 in N. crassa. Similarly, the ADV-1 homolog NosA regulates hamE-I expression in A. flavus, is required for sclerotial development and is itself positively regulated by LaeA. We speculate that a putative LaeA>NosA>fusion cascade underlies the previously described circadian clock regulation of sclerotia production in A. flavus.","['adv-1', 'aflatoxin', 'ham-6', 'ham-9', 'hyphal fusion', 'nosA']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2017
27032478,Signal exchange and integration during self-fusion in filamentous fungi.,"Growth and propagation of filamentous ascomycete fungi commonly involves vegetative cell fusion. In the red bread mold Neurospora crassa and many other ascomycete species, fusion occurs between germinating spores during colony formation and between hyphal branches in established mycelia. Both fusion processes promote the development and behavior of the fungal colony as a supra-cellular network. Germling and hyphal fusion in N. crassa rely on an unusual mode of cellular communication, in which the two fusion partners likely alternate between signal emission and reception, thereby establishing a kind of ""cell dialog"". In recent years, numerous molecular factors mediating this unique cellular behavior have been identified, including several conserved signal transmission pathways, as well as proteins specific for ascomycete fungi. Analysis of their molecular interactions revealed the presence of an intricate signaling network, whose sophisticated interconnections are still unfolding. Despite this complexity, germling and hyphal fusion provide experimentally easily amenable model systems and might therefore advance as paradigms for signal transmission and cell fusion.

Theoretical search for the DNA structures consistent with those genetic results has led to an all-atom model in which the B-DNA conformation of the paired double helices is strongly shifted toward C-DNA. Coincidentally, C-DNA also features a very shallow major groove that could permit initial homologous contacts without atom-atom clashes.

33141925,Sphingolipid-enriched domains in fungi.,"Plasma membrane carries out multiple physiological functions that require its dynamic and tightly regulated organization into specialized domains of different size, stability, and lipid/protein composition. Sphingolipids are a group of lipids in which the plasma membrane is particularly enriched, thus being crucial for its structure and function. A specific type of sphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane domains, where ergosterol is depleted and lipids are tightly packed in a rigid gel phase, has recently been found in several fungal species, including yeasts and moulds. After presenting the main biophysical features of gel domains and the experimental method for their detection in the fungal plasma membrane, we review these sphingolipid-enriched gel domains and illustrate their importance to both unicellular and multicellular fungi. First, the biophysical properties of the fungal sphingolipid-enriched domains will be analysed taking into consideration the plasma membrane sphingolipidome. Next, their possible biological roles will be summarized, including their relations with plasma membrane compartments and involvement in stress responses. Moreover, since the plasma membrane is a target for several antifungal compounds, a biophysical connection between sphingolipid-enriched domains and antifungal action will be explored.","['Neurospora crassa', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'antifungal agents', 'ergosterol', 'gel domains', 'glucosylceramides', 'inositolphosphorylceramides', 'membrane compartments MCC and MCP', 'plasma membrane', 'sphingolipid domains']",FEBS letters,Portugal,2020 Nov
26908646,The kinetochore interaction network (KIN) of ascomycetes.,"Chromosome segregation relies on coordinated activity of a large assembly of proteins, the kinetochore interaction network (KIN). How conserved the underlying mechanisms driving the epigenetic phenomenon of centromere and kinetochore assembly and maintenance are remains unclear, even though various eukaryotic models have been studied. More than 50 different proteins, many in multiple copies, comprise the KIN or are associated with fungal centromeres and kinetochores. Proteins isolated from immune sera recognized centromeric regions on chromosomes and thus were named centromere proteins (CENPs). CENP-A, sometimes called centromere-specific H3 (CenH3), is incorporated into nucleosomes within or near centromeres. The constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) assembles on this specialized chromatin, likely based on specific interactions with and requiring presence of CENP-C. The outer kinetochore comprises the Knl1-Mis12-Ndc80 (KMN) protein complexes that connect CCAN to spindles, accomplished by binding and stabilizing microtubules (MTs) and in the process generating load-bearing assemblies for chromatid segregation. In most fungi the Dam1/DASH complex connects the KMN complexes to MTs. Fungi present a rich resource to investigate mechanistic commonalities but also differences in kinetochore architecture. While ascomycetes have sets of CCAN and KMN proteins that are conserved with those of budding yeast or metazoans, searching other major branches of the fungal kingdom revealed that CCAN proteins are poorly conserved at the primary sequence level. Several conserved binding motifs or domains within KMN complexes have been described recently, and these features of ascomycete KIN proteins are shared with most metazoan proteins. In addition, several ascomycete-specific domains have been identified here.","['CCAN', 'Dam1', 'KMN', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Zymoseptoria tritici', 'centromere', 'histones', 'kinetochore']",Mycologia,Oregon 97331-7305 freitagm@oregonstate.edu,2016 May-Jun
34882532,Application of fungal copper carbonate nanoparticles as environmental catalysts: organic dye degradation and chromate removal.,"Biomineralization is a ubiquitous process in organisms to produce biominerals, and a wide range of metallic nanoscale minerals can be produced as a consequence of the interactions of micro-organisms with metals and minerals. Copper-bearing nanoparticles produced by biomineralization mechanisms have a variety of applications due to their remarkable catalytic efficiency, antibacterial properties and low production cost. In this study, we demonstrate the biotechnological potential of copper carbonate nanoparticles (CuNPs) synthesized using a carbonate-enriched biomass-free ureolytic fungal spent culture supernatant. The efficiency of the CuNPs in pollutant remediation was investigated using a dye (methyl red) and a toxic metal oxyanion, chromate Cr(VI). The biogenic CuNPs exhibited excellent catalytic properties in a Fenton-like reaction to degrade methyl red, and efficiently removed Cr(VI) from solution due to both adsorption and reduction of Cr(VI). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) identified the oxidation of reducing Cu species of the CuNPs during the reaction with Cr(VI). This work shows that urease-positive fungi can play an important role not only in the biorecovery of metals through the production of insoluble nanoscale carbonates, but also provides novel and simple strategies for the preparation of sustainable nanomineral products with catalytic properties applicable to the bioremediation of organic and metallic pollutants, solely and in mixtures.","['Neurospora crassa', 'bioremediation', 'biosynthesis', 'copper nanoparticles', 'fungi']","Microbiology (Reading, England)",UK,2021 Dec

24677771,Fungal secretomes enhance sugar beet pulp hydrolysis.,"The recalcitrance of lignocellulose makes enzymatic hydrolysis of plant biomass for the production of second generation biofuels a major challenge. This work investigates an efficient and economic approach for the enzymatic hydrolysis of sugar beet pulp (SBP), which is a difficult to degrade, hemicellulose-rich by-product of the table sugar industry. Three fungal strains were grown on different substrates and the production of various extracellular hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes involved in pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose breakdown were monitored. In a second step, the ability of the culture supernatants to hydrolyze thermally pretreated SBP was tested in batch experiments. The supernatant of Sclerotium rolfsii, a soil-borne facultative plant pathogen, was found to have the highest hydrolytic activity on SBP and was selected for further hydrolyzation experiments. A low enzyme load of 0.2 mg g(-1) protein from the culture supernatant was sufficient to hydrolyze a large fraction of the pectin and hemicelluloses present in SBP. The addition of Trichoderma reesei cellulase (1-17.5 mg g(-1) SBP) resulted in almost complete hydrolyzation of cellulose. It was found that the combination of pectinolytic, hemicellulolytic, and cellulolytic activities works synergistically on the complex SBP composite, and a combination of these hydrolytic enzymes is required to achieve a high degree of enzymatic SBP hydrolysis with a low enzyme load.","['Cellulases', 'Hemicellulases', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Sclerotium rolfsii', 'Trametes multicolor']",Biotechnology journal,Austria,2014 Apr
35525939,Toward more efficient ergothioneine production using the fungal ergothioneine biosynthetic pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Ergothioneine (ERG) is a potent histidine-derived antioxidant that confers health-promoting effects. Only certain bacteria and fungi can biosynthesize ERG, but the ERG productivity in natural producers is low. ERG overproduction through genetic engineering represents an efficient and cost-effective manufacturing strategy. RESULTS: Here, we showed that Trichoderma reesei can synthesize ERG during conidiogenesis and hyphal growth. Co-expression of two ERG biosynthesis genes (tregt1 and tregt2) from T. reesei enabled E. coli to generate 70.59 mg/L ERG at the shaking flask level after 48 h of whole-cell biocatalysis, whereas minor amounts of ERG were synthesized by the recombinant E. coli strain bearing only the tregt1 gene. By fed-batch fermentation, the extracellular ERG production reached 4.34 g/L after 143 h of cultivation in a 2-L jar fermenter, which is the highest level of ERG production reported thus far. Similarly, ERG synthesis also occurred in the E. coli strain engineered with the two well-characterized genes from N. crassa and the ERG productivity was up to 4.22 g/L after 143 h of cultivation under the above-mentioned conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the overproduction of ERG in E. coli could be achieved through two-enzymatic steps, demonstrating high efficiency of the fungal ERG biosynthetic pathway. Meanwhile, this work offers a more promising approach for the industrial production of ERG.","['Biosynthesis', 'Ergothioneine', 'Escherichia coli', 'Heterologous expression', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Trichoderma reesei']",Microbial cell factories,China,2022 May 7
29602785,The Pyrroloquinoline-Quinone-Dependent Pyranose Dehydrogenase from Coprinopsis cinerea Drives Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase Action.,"Fungi secrete a set of glycoside hydrolases and oxidoreductases, including lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), for the degradation of plant polysaccharides. LPMOs catalyze the oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds after activation by an external electron donor. So far, only flavin-dependent oxidoreductases (from the auxiliary activity [AA] family AA3) have been shown to activate LPMOs. Here, we present LPMO activation by a pyrroloquinoline-quinone (PQQ)-dependent pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH) from Coprinopsis cinerea, CcPDH, the founding member of the recently discovered auxiliary activity family AA12. CcPDH contains a C-terminal family 1 carbohydrate binding module (CBM1), an N-terminal family AA8 cytochrome domain, and a central AA12 dehydrogenase domain. We have studied the ability of full-length CcPDH and its truncated variants to drive catalysis by two Neurospora crassa LPMOs. The results show that CcPDH indeed can activate the C-1-oxidizing N. crassa LPMO 9F (NcLPMO9F) and the C-4-oxidizing Neurospora crassa LPMO 9C (NcLPMO9C), that this activation depends on the cytochrome domain, and that the dehydrogenase and the LPMO reactions are strongly coupled. The two tested CcPDH-LPMO systems showed quite different efficiencies, and this difference disappeared upon the addition of free PQQ acting as a diphenol/quinone redox mediator, showing that LPMOs differ when it comes to their direct interactions with the cytochrome domain. Surprisingly, removal of the CBM domain from CcPDH had a considerable negative impact on the efficiency of the CcPDH-LPMO systems, suggesting that electron transfer in the vicinity of the substrate is beneficial. CcPDH does not oxidize cello-oligosaccharides, which makes this enzyme a useful tool for studying cellulose-oxidizing LPMOs.IMPORTANCE Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are currently receiving increasing attention because of their importance in degrading recalcitrant polysaccharides and their potential roles in biological processes, such as bacterial virulence. LPMO action requires an external electron donor, and fungi growing on biomass secrete various so-called glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases, including cellobiose dehydrogenase, which can donate electrons to LPMOs. This paper describes how an enzyme not belonging to the GMC oxidoreductase family, CcPDH, can activate LPMOs, and it provides new insights into the activation process by (i) describing the roles of individual CcPDH domains (a dehydrogenase, a cytochrome, and a carbohydrate-binding domain), (ii) showing that the PDH and LPMO enzyme reactions are strongly coupled, (iii) demonstrating that LPMOs differ in terms of their efficiencies of activation by the same activator, and (iv) providing indications that electron transferring close to the substrate surface is beneficial for the overall efficiency of the CcPDH-LPMO system.","['AA12', 'AA9', 'LPMO', 'PQQ-dependent PDH', 'carbohydrate-binding module', 'electron transfer', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase']",Applied and environmental microbiology,Norway,2018 Jun 1

26013991,Population genomic analyses reveal possible drivers of population divergence.,"Recent advances in sequencing technology and efficiency enable new and improved methods to investigate how populations diverge and species evolve. Fungi have relatively small and simple genomes and can often be cultured in the laboratory. Fungal populations can thus be sequenced for a relatively low cost, which makes them ideal for population genomic analyses. In several recent population genomic studies, wild populations of fungal model organisms and human pathogens have been analysed, for example Neurospora crassa (Ellison et al. ), Saccharomyces uvarum (Almeida et al. ), Coccidioides spp. (Neafsey et al. ) and Cryptococcus gatti (Engelthaler et al. ). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Branco et al. () apply population genomic tools to understand population divergence and adaptation in a symbiotic (mycorrhizal) fungus. This study exemplifies the possibilities of diving deeper into the genomic features involved in population divergence and speciation, also for nonmodel organisms, and how molecular and analytical tools will improve our understanding of the patterns and mechanisms that underlie adaptation to habitats, population divergence and dispersal limitation of fungi.","['functional adaptation', 'fungi', 'population divergence', 'population genomics']",Molecular ecology,Norway,2015 Jun
30389803,Analysis of Repeat Induced Point (RIP) Mutations in Leptosphaeria maculans Indicates Variability in the RIP Process Between Fungal Species.,"Gene duplication contributes to evolutionary potential, yet many duplications in a genome arise from the activity of ""selfish"" genetic elements such as transposable elements. Fungi have a number of mechanisms by which they limit the expansion of transposons, including Repeat Induced Point mutation (RIP). RIP has been best characterized in the Sordariomycete Neurospora crassa, wherein duplicated DNA regions are recognized after cell fusion, but before nuclear fusion during the sexual cycle, and then mutated. While ""signatures"" of RIP appear in the genome sequences of many fungi, the species most distant from N. crassa in which the process has been experimentally demonstrated to occur is the Dothideomycete Leptosphaeria maculans In the current study, we show that similar to N. crassa, nonlinked duplications can trigger RIP; however, the frequency of the generated RIP mutations is extremely low in L maculans (< 0.1%) and requires a large duplication to initiate RIP, and that multiple premeiotic mitoses are involved in the RIP process. However, a single sexual cycle leads to the generation of progeny with unique haplotypes, despite progeny pairs being generated from mitosis. We hypothesize that these different haplotypes may be the result of the deamination process occurring post karyogamy, leading to unique mutations within each of the progeny pairs. These findings indicate that the RIP process, while common to many fungi, differs between fungi and that this impacts on the fate of duplicated DNA.","['RIP timing', 'ascomycete', 'genome defense', 'repetitive DNA']",Genetics,Australia apvdw2@unimelb.edu.au,2019 Jan
24375151,The importance of pyroglutamate in cellulase Cel7A.,"The commercialization of lignocellulosic biofuels relies in part on the ability to engineer cellulase enzymes to have properties compatible with practical processing conditions. The cellulase Cel7A has been a common engineering target because it is present in very high concentrations in commercial cellulase cocktails. Significant effort has thus been focused on its recombinant expression. In particular, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has often been used both in the engineering and basic study of Cel7A. However, the expression titer and extent of glycosylation of Cel7A expressed in S. cerevisiae vary widely for Cel7A genes from different organisms, and the recombinant enzymes tend to be less active and less stable than their native counterparts. These observations motivate further study of recombinant expression of Cel7A in S. cerevisiae. Here, we compare the properties of Cel7A from Talaromyces emersonii expressed in both the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The Cel7A expressed in N. crassa had a higher melting temperature (by 10 degrees C) and higher specific activity (twofold at 65 degrees C) than the Cel7A expressed in S. cerevisiae. We examined several post-translational modifications and found that the underlying cause of this disparity was the lack of N-terminal glutamine cyclization in the Cel7A expressed in S. cerevisiae. Treating the enzyme in vitro with glutaminyl cyclase improved the properties of Cel7A expressed in S. cerevisiae to match those of Cel7A expressed in N. crassa.","['Cel7A', 'N-terminal glutamine cyclization', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'glutaminyl cyclase', 'protein engineering', 'pyroglutamate', 'recombinant expression']",Biotechnology and bioengineering,94720,2014 Apr
27039027,Circadian clocks and the regulation of virulence in fungi: Getting up to speed.,"You cannot escape time. Therefore, it seems wise to learn how to keep track of it and use it to your advantage. Circadian clocks are molecular circuits that allow organisms to temporally coordinate a plethora of processes, including gene expression, with a close to 24h rhythm, optimizing cellular function in synchrony with daily environmental cycles. The molecular bases of these clocks have been extensively studied in the fungus Neurospora crassa, providing a detailed molecular description. Surprisingly, there is scarce molecular information of clocks in fungi other than Neurospora, despite the existence of rhythmic phenomena in many fungal species, including pathogenic ones. This review will comment on the overall importance of clocks, what is known in Neurospora and what has been described in other fungi including new insights on the evolution of fungal clock components. The molecular description of the circadian system of the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea will be revisited, as well as time-of-the-day variation in host-pathogen interaction dynamics, utilizing an Arabidopsis-Botrytis system, including also what is known regarding circadian regulation of defense mechanisms in the Arabidopsis thaliana plant model.

Here, we developed a fluorescent strategy based on chitosan-modified fluorescein isothiocyanate (GC-FITC) to monitor the cell growth of lignocellulosic fungi cultivated on biopolymers. GC-FITC could stain only lignocellulosic fungi (Tricoderma reesei, Penicillium oxalicum, Aspergillus nidulans, and Neurospora crassa), but not biopolymers (cellulose, xylan, pectin, or lignin), excluding the interferences from these insoluble biopolymer. Moreover, a linear relationship was observed between the fluorescence intensity of GC-FITC absorbed by lignocellulosic fungi and the biomass of lignocellulosic fungi. Therefore, GC-FITC was leveraged to monitor the cell growth of lignocellulosic fungi when using biopolymers like cellulose as the carbon sources, which is faster, more convenient, time-saving, and cost-effective than the existing methods using protein/DNA content measurement.

24502254,Identification and characterization of a galacturonic acid transporter from Neurospora crassa and its application for Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation processes.,"BACKGROUND: Pectin-rich agricultural wastes potentially represent favorable feedstocks for the sustainable production of alternative energy and bio-products. Their efficient utilization requires the conversion of all major constituent sugars. The current inability of the popular fermentation host Saccharomyces cerevisiae to metabolize the major pectic monosaccharide D-galacturonic acid (D-GalA) significantly hampers these efforts. While it has been reasoned that the optimization of cellular D-GalA uptake will be critical for the engineering of D-GalA utilization in yeast, no dedicated eukaryotic transport protein has been biochemically described. Here we report for the first time such a eukaryotic D-GalA transporter and characterize its functionality in S. cerevisiae. RESULTS: We identified and characterized the D-GalA transporter GAT-1 out of a group of candidate genes obtained from co-expression analysis in N. crassa. The N. crassa Deltagat-1 deletion strain is substantially affected in growth on pectic substrates, unable to take up D-GalA, and impaired in D-GalA-mediated signaling events. Moreover, expression of a gat-1 construct in yeast conferred the ability for strong high-affinity D-GalA accumulation rates, providing evidence for GAT-1 being a bona fide D-GalA transport protein. By recombinantly co-expressing D-galacturonate reductase or uronate dehydrogenase in yeast we furthermore demonstrated a transporter-dependent conversion of D-GalA towards more reduced (L-galactonate) or oxidized (meso-galactaric acid) downstream products, respectively, over a broad concentration range. CONCLUSIONS: By utilizing the novel D-GalA transporter GAT-1 in S. cerevisiae we successfully generated a transporter-dependent uptake and catalysis system for D-GalA into two products with high potential for utilization as platform chemicals. Our data thereby provide a considerable first step towards a more complete utilization of biomass for biofuel and value-added chemicals production.",?,Biotechnology for biofuels,USA. ph.benz@berkeley.edu,2014 Feb 6

The use of chitosan in clinical medicine to control infections by fungal pathogens such as Candida spp. is one of its most promising applications in view of the reduced number of antifungals available. Chitosan increases intracellular oxidative stress, then permeabilizes the plasma membrane of sensitive filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa and yeast. Transcriptomics reveals plasma membrane homeostasis and oxidative metabolism genes as key players in the response of fungi to chitosan. A lipase and a monosaccharide transporter, both inner plasma membrane proteins, and a glutathione transferase are main chitosan targets in N. crassa. Biocontrol fungi such as Pochonia chlamydosporia have a low content of polyunsaturated free fatty acids in their plasma membranes and are resistant to chitosan. Genome sequencing of P. chlamydosporia reveals a wide gene machinery to degrade and assimilate chitosan.

33013740,No Evidence That Homologs of Key Circadian Clock Genes Direct Circadian Programs of Development or mRNA Abundance in Verticillium dahliae.,"Many organisms harbor circadian clocks that promote their adaptation to the rhythmic environment. While a broad knowledge of the molecular mechanism of circadian clocks has been gained through the fungal model Neurospora crassa, little is known about circadian clocks in other fungi. N. crassa belongs to the same class as many important plant pathogens including the vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae. We identified homologs of N. crassa clock proteins in V. dahliae, which showed high conservation in key protein domains. However, no evidence for an endogenous, free-running and entrainable rhythm was observed in the daily formation of conidia and microsclerotia. In N. crassa the frequency (frq) gene encodes a central clock protein expressed rhythmically and in response to light. In contrast, expression of Vdfrq is not light-regulated. Temporal gene expression profiling over 48 h in constant darkness and temperature revealed no circadian expression of key clock genes. Furthermore, RNA-seq over a 24 h time-course revealed no robust oscillations of clock-associated transcripts in constant darkness. Comparison of gene expression between wild-type V. dahliae and a DeltaVdfrq mutant showed that genes involved in metabolism, transport and redox processes are mis-regulated in the absence of Vdfrq. In addition, VdDeltafrq mutants display growth defects and reduced pathogenicity in a strain dependent manner. Our data indicate that if a circadian clock exists in Verticillium, it is based on alternative mechanisms such as post-transcriptional interactions of VdFRQ and the WC proteins or the components of a FRQ-less oscillator. Alternatively, it could be that whilst the original functions of the clock proteins have been maintained, in this species the interactions that generate robust rhythmicity have been lost or are only triggered when specific environmental conditions are met. The presence of conserved clock genes in genomes should not be taken as definitive evidence of circadian function.","['Verticillium dahliae', 'circadian clock', 'evolution', 'gene expression', 'plant pathogen']",Frontiers in microbiology,United Kingdom,2020
25921726,A lipid-managing program maintains a stout Spitzenkorper.,"The Spitzenkorper (SPK) is an accumulation of vesicles interleaved with actin microfilaments present at the cytosolic side of the apical plasma membrane (PM) of hyphal tips of many species of filamentous fungi. The physiological role of the SPK has captivated fungal biologists over the years, but only very recently this 'organelle' is starting to be understood in the molecular terminology used for cell biological models. One aspect that has received little attention is the role of cellular membrane asymmetry in the organization of membrane traffic, in particular in the genetic and cell biological model Aspergillus nidulans. The paper by Schultzhaus et al. (2015) in this issue breaks the ice, providing original insight that may foster research in phospholipid composition in the context of intracellular traffic and the organization of the SPK. Notably, it shows that like the stout Neurospora crassa SPK, the much slimmer one of A. nidulans, appears to be formed by different strata, altogether suggesting that the SPK might be a mosaic of exocytic carriers with different functional specializations, and a major sorting hub for intracellular membranes.",?,Molecular microbiology,Spain,2015 Jul
23721733,The Trichoderma atroviride photolyase-encoding gene is transcriptionally regulated by non-canonical light response elements.,"The BLR-1 and BLR-2 proteins of Trichoderma atroviride are the Neurospora crassa homologs of white collar-1 and -2, two transcription factors involved in the regulation of genes by blue light. BLR-1 and BLR-2 are essential for photoinduction of phr-1, a photolyase-encoding gene whose promoter exhibits sequences similar to well-characterized light regulatory elements of Neurospora, including the albino proximal element and the light response element (LRE). However, despite the fact that this gene has been extensively used as a blue light induction marker in Trichoderma, the function of these putative regulatory elements has not been proved. The described LRE core in N. crassa comprises two close but variably spaced GATA boxes to which a WC-1/-2 complex binds transiently upon application of a light stimulus. Using 5' serial deletions of the phr-1 promoter, as well as point mutations of putative LREs, we were able to delimit an ~ 50 bp long region mediating the transcriptional response to blue light. The identified light-responsive region contained five CGATB motifs, three of them displaying opposite polarity to canonical WCC binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the BLR-2 protein binds along the phr-1 promoter in darkness, whereas the application of a blue light pulse results in decreased BLR-2 binding to the promoter. Our results suggest that BLR-2 and probably BLR-1 are located on the phr-1 promoter in darkness ready to perform their function as transcriptional complex in response to light.","['BLR proteins', 'Trichoderma', 'blue light', 'light response element', 'phr-1']",The FEBS journal,Mexico,2013 Aug

Much of what we know about histone modification enzymes, RNA interference, DNA methylation, and cell cycle control was first addressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus nidulans, and Neurospora crassa. Here, we examine the three landmark regions that are required for maintenance of stable chromosomes and their faithful inheritance, namely, origins of DNA replication, telomeres and centromeres. We summarize the state of recent chromatin research that explains what is required for normal function of these specialized chromosomal regions in different fungi, with an emphasis on the silencing mechanism associated with subtelomeric regions, initiated by sirtuin histone deacetylases and histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferases. We explore mechanisms for the appearance of ""accessory"" or ""conditionally dispensable"" chromosomes and contrast what has been learned from studies on genome-wide chromosome conformation capture in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, N. crassa, and Trichoderma reesei. While most of the current knowledge is based on work in a handful of genetically and biochemically tractable model organisms, we suggest where major knowledge gaps remain to be closed.

31844846,Circadian Rhythms in Neurospora Exhibit Biologically Relevant Driven and Damped Harmonic Oscillations.,"Circadian rhythms are endogenous cycles of approximately 24 hours reinforced by external cues such as light. These cycles are typically modeled as harmonic oscillators with fixed amplitude peaks. Using experimental data measuring global gene transcription in Neurospora crassa over 48 hours in the dark (i.e. with external queues removed), we demonstrate that many circadian genes frequently exhibit either damped harmonic oscillations, in which the peak amplitudes decrease each day, or driven harmonic oscillations, in which the peak amplitudes increase each day. By fitting extended harmonic oscillator models which include a damping ratio coefficient, we detected additional circadian genes that were not identified by the current standard tools that use fixed amplitude waves as reference, e.g. JTK_CYCLE. Functional Catalogue analysis confirms that our identified damped or driven genes exhibit distinct biological functions. The application of extended damped/driven harmonic oscillator models thus can elucidate, not only previously unidentified circadian genes, but also characterize gene subsets with expression patterns of biological relevance. Thus, expanded harmonic oscillators provide a powerful new tool for circadian system biology.","['Circadian Rhythm', 'Damped Harmonic Oscillator', 'Driven Harmonic Oscillator', 'Gene Transcription', 'Harmonic Oscillator']","ACM-BCB ... ... : the ...

The relationship among the circadian clock, cancer and DNA methylation at clock genes suggests a correlative indication that improper DNA methylation may influence clock gene expression, contributing to the etiology of cancer. The molecular mechanism underlying DNA methylation at clock loci is best studied in the filamentous fungi, Neurospora crassa, and recent data indicate a mechanism analogous to the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) or RNAi-mediated facultative heterochromatin. Although it is still unclear, DNA methylation at clock genes may function as a terminal modification that serves to prevent the regulated removal of histone modifications. In this capacity, aberrant DNA methylation may serve as a readout of misregulated clock genes and not as the causative agent. This review explores the implications of DNA methylation at clock loci and describes what is currently known regarding the molecular mechanism underlying DNA methylation at circadian clock genes.",?,Biology,USA. tjoska@gmail.com,2014 Sep 5
26882011,"The Fungus Tremella mesenterica Encodes the Longest Metallothionein Currently Known: Gene, Protein and Metal Binding Characterization.","Fungal Cu-thioneins, and among them, the paradigmatic Neurospora crassa metallothionein (MT) (26 residues), were once considered as the shortest MTs--the ubiquitous, versatile metal-binding proteins--among all organisms, and thus representatives of their primeval forms. Nowadays, fungal MTs of diverse lengths and sequence features are known, following the huge heterogeneity of the Kingdom of Fungi. At the opposite end of N. crassa MT, the recently reported Cryptococcus neoformans CnMT1 and CnMT2 (122 and 186 aa) constitute the longest reported fungal MTs, having been identified as virulence factors of this pathogen. CnMTs are high-capacity Cu-thioneins that appear to be built by tandem amplification of a basic unit, a 7-Cys segment homologous to N. crassa MT. Here, we report the in silico, in vivo and in vitro study of a still longer fungal MT, belonging to Tremella mesenterica (TmMT), a saprophytic ascomycete. The TmMT gene has 10 exons, and it yields a 779-bp mature transcript that encodes a 257 residue-long protein. This MT is also built by repeated fragments, but of variable number of Cys: six units of the 7-Cys building blocks--CXCX3CSCPPGXCXCAXCP-, two fragments of six Cys, plus three Cys at the N-terminus. TmMT metal binding abilities have been analyzed through the spectrophotometric and spectrometric characterization of its recombinant Zn-, Cd- and Cu-complexes. Results allow it to be unambiguous classified as a Cu-thionein, also of extraordinary coordinating capacity. According to this feature, when the TmMT cDNA is expressed in MT-devoid yeast cells, it is capable of restoring a high Cu tolerance level. Since it is not obvious that T. mesenterica shares the same physiological needs for a high capacity Cu-binding protein with C. neoformans, the existence of this peculiar MT might be better explained on the basis of a possible role in Cu-handling for the Cu-enzymes responsible in lignin degradation pathways.",?,PloS one,Spain,2016
25897010,Neurospora Heterokaryons with Complementary Duplications and Deficiencies in Their Constituent Nuclei Provide an Approach to Identify Nucleus-Limited Genes.,"Introgression is the transfer of genes or genomic regions from one species into another via hybridization and back-crosses. We have introgressed four translocations (EB4, IBj5, UK14-1, and B362i) from Neurospora crassa into N. tetrasperma. This enabled us to construct two general types of heterokaryons with mat-A and mat-a nuclei of different genotypes: one type is [T + N] (with one translocation nucleus and one normal sequence nucleus), and the other is [Dp + Df] (with one nucleus carrying a duplication of the translocation region and the other being deleted for the translocation region). Self-crossing these heterokaryons again produced [T + N] and [Dp + Df] progeny. From conidia (vegetative spores) produced by the heterokaryotic mycelia, we obtained self-fertile (heterokaryotic) and self-sterile (homokaryotic) derivative strains. [T + N] heterokaryons produced homokaryotic conidial derivatives of both mating types, but [Dp + Df] heterokaryons produced viable conidial homokaryons of only the mating type of the Dp nucleus. All four [T + N] heterokaryons and three [Dp + Df] heterokaryons produced both self-sterile and self-fertile conidial derivatives, but the [Dp(B362i) + Df(B362i)] heterokaryons produced only self-sterile ones. Conceivably, the Df(B362i) nuclei may be deleted for a nucleus-limited gene required for efficient mitosis or nuclear division, and whose deficit is not complemented by the neighboring Dp(B362i) nuclei. A cross involving Dp(EB4) showed repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Because RIP can occur in self-crosses of [Dp + Df] but not [T + N] heterokaryons, RIP alteration of a translocated segment would depend on the relative numbers of [Dp + Df] vs. [T + N] ancestors.","['MSUD', 'RIP', 'chromosome translocation', 'introgression', 'pseudohomothallism']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",India,2015 Apr 20
32968492,Microfluidic monitoring of the growth of individual hyphae in confined environments.,"Soil fungi have the ability to form large mycelial networks. They rely on the resources available in the soil to produce biomass and are able to degrade complex biomolecules. Some of them can even degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants and are considered as promising candidates for soil bioremediation strategies. However, the success of this approach depends on the ability of fungi to colonize the soil matrix, where they encounter spatial and temporal variations of confinement, humidity and nutrient concentration. In this paper, we present a study of fungal growth at the scale of single hyphae in a microfluidic device, allowing fine control of nutrient and water supply. Time-lapse microscopy allowed simultaneous monitoring of the growth of dozens of hyphae of Talaromyces helicus, a soil isolate, and of the model fungus Neurospora crassa through parallel microchannels. The distributions of growth velocity obtained for each strain were compared with measurements obtained in macroscopic solid culture. For the two strains used in the study, confinement caused the growth velocity to drop in comparison with unconfined experiments. In addition, N. crassa was also limited in its growth by the nutrient supply, while the microfluidic culture conditions seemed better suited for T. helicus. Qualitative observations of fungi growing in microfluidic chambers without lateral confinement also revealed that side walls influence the branching behaviour of hyphae. This study is one of the first to consider the confinement degree within soil microporosities as a key factor of fungal growth, and to address its effect, along with physicochemical parameters, on soil colonization, notably for bioremediation purposes.","['fungi', 'growth', 'microfluidics']",Royal Society open science,France,2020 Aug
29801792,"Light, stress, sex and carbon - The photoreceptor ENVOY as a central checkpoint in the physiology of Trichoderma reesei.","Trichoderma reesei represents one of the most prolific producers of homologous and heterologous proteins. Discovery of the photoreceptor ENV1 as a regulator of cellulase gene expression initiated analysis of light response pathways and their physiological relevance for T. reesei. The function of ENV1 in regulation of plant cell wall degrading enzymes is conserved in Neurospora crassa. ENV1 emerged as a central checkpoint for integration of nutrient sensing, light response and development. This photoreceptor exerts its function by influencing transcript abundance and feedback cycles of the alpha subunits of the heterotrimeric G-protein pathway and impacts regulation of the beta and gamma subunits via mutual regulation with the phosducin PhLP1. The output of regulation by ENV1 is in part mediated by the cAMP pathway and likely aimed at cellulose recognition. Lack of ENV1 causes deregulation of the pheromone system and female sterility in light. A regulatory interconnection with VEL1 and influence on other regulators of secondary metabolism like YPR2 as well as polyketide synthase encoding genes indicates a function in secondary metabolism. The function of ENV1 in integrating light response with signaling of osmotic and oxidative stress is evolutionary conserved in Hypocreales and distinct from other sordariomycetes including N. crassa.","['Cellulases', 'Hypocrea jecorina', 'Mating', 'Photoreceptors', 'Sexual development', 'Stress response']",Fungal biology,Austria.

26497142,Extreme Diversity in the Regulation of Ndt80-Like Transcription Factors in Fungi.,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ndt80 protein is the founding member of a class of p53-like transcription factors that is known as the NDT80/PhoG-like DNA-binding family. The number of NDT80-like genes in different fungi is highly variable and their roles, which have been examined in only a few species, include regulation of meiosis, sexual development, biofilm formation, drug resistance, virulence, the response to nutrient stress and programmed cell death. The protein kinase Ime2 regulates the single NDT80 gene present in S. cerevisiae. In this study we used a genetic approach to investigate whether the Aspergillus nidulans Ime2 homolog, ImeB, and/or protein kinases MpkC, PhoA and PhoB regulate the two NDT80-like genes (xprG and ndtA) in A. nidulans. Disruption of imeB, but not mpkC, phoA or phoB, led to increased extracellular protease activity and a defect in mycotoxin production similar to the xprG1 gain-of-function mutation. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that ImeB is a negative regulator of xprG expression and XprG is a negative regulator of xprG and ndtA expression. Thus, in contrast to Ime2, which is a positive regulator of NDT80 in S. cerevisiae, ImeB is a negative regulator as in Neurospora crassa. However, the ability of Ndt80 to autoregulate NDT80 is conserved in A. nidulans though the autoregulatory effect is negative rather than positive. Unlike N. crassa, a null mutation in imeB does not circumvent the requirement for XprG or NdtA. These results show that the regulatory activities of Ime2 and Ndt80-like proteins display an extraordinarily level of evolutionary flexibility.","['Aspergillus nidulans', 'Ime2', 'Ndt80', 'XprG', 'nutrient stress']","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",NSW 2351 Australia mkatz@une.edu.au,2015 Oct 23
35633691,Metagenome Sequencing Reveals the Microbiome of Aedes albopictus and Its Possible Relationship With Dengue Virus Susceptibility.,"Dengue fever virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses a serious risk to human health. Aedes albopictus is a widely distributed vector of dengue fever in China. Based on the impact of physiological activity, the microbiome in A. albopictus will provide a novel environment-friendly approach to control DENV transmission. We performed metagenomic sequencing on A. albopictus before and after exposure to DENV blood meal to detect microbiome variation of A. albopictus with different susceptibilities to DENV. The dominant phyla in A. albopictus microbiome were Proteobacteria and Ascomycota, and the dominant genera were Aspergillus and Metarhizium. Gammaproteobacteria bacterium, Lactobacillus harbinensis, and Neurospora crassa differed significantly after DENV infection. There were 15 different microorganisms found to be involved in mosquito immunity and metabolism, such as Alphaproteobacteria bacterium, Methyloglobulus morosus, and Shigella sonnei, which might have an impact on the DENV susceptibility of A. albopictus. It was hypothesized that the lack of specific bacteria may lead to increased susceptibility of A. albopictus to DENV. Interventions in the microbiome composition or specific bacteria of A. albopictus may affect the susceptibility to DENV and control the mosquito-borne diseases efficiently.","['Aedes albopictus', 'dengue virus', 'metagenome', 'microbiome', 'susceptibility']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2022
30866114,Enzymatic One-Step Reduction of Carboxylates to Aldehydes with Cell-Free Regeneration of ATP and NADPH.,"The direct generation of aldehydes from carboxylic acids is often a challenging synthetic task but undoubtedly attractive in view of abundant supply of such feedstocks from nature. Though long known, biocatalytic carboxylate reductions are at an early stage of development, presumably because of their co-factor requirement. To establish an alternative to whole-cell-based carboxylate reductions which are limited by side reactions, we developed an in vitro multi-enzyme system that allows for quantitative reductions of various carboxylic acids with full recycling of all cofactors and prevention of undesired over-reductions. Regeneration of adenosine 5'-triphosphate is achieved through the simultaneous action of polyphosphate kinases from Meiothermus ruber and Sinorhizobium meliloti and beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate is reduced by a glucose dehydrogenase. Under these conditions and in the presence of the carboxylate reductases from Neurospora crassa or Nocardia iowensis, various aromatic, heterocyclic and aliphatic carboxylic acids were quantitatively reduced to the respective aldehydes.","['aldehyde', 'carboxylate reductase', 'enzyme cascade', 'in vitro ATP generation', 'multi-enzyme catalysis']","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",Austria,2019 Apr 26
26830230,De Novo RNA Synthesis by RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Activity of Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase.,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) plays key roles in RNA silencing to generate double-stranded RNAs. In model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Neurospora crassa, two types of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), primary siRNAs and secondary siRNAs, are expressed; RdRP produces secondary siRNAs de novo, without using either Dicer or primers, while primary siRNAs are processed by Dicer. We reported that human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has RdRP activity and produces endogenous siRNAs in a Dicer-dependent manner. However, de novo synthesis of siRNAs by human TERT has not been elucidated. Here we show that the TERT RdRP generates short RNAs that are complementary to template RNAs and have 5'-triphosphorylated ends, which indicates de novo synthesis of the RNAs. In addition, we confirmed short RNA synthesis by TERT in several human carcinoma cell lines and found that TERT protein levels are positively correlated with RdRP activity.",?,Molecular and cellular biology,Japan,2016 Apr

Interestingly, a number of Epichloe festucae genes that are required for hyphal cell-cell fusion, such as noxA, noxR, proA, mpkA and mkkA, are also required for the establishment of a mutualistic symbiotic interaction with Lolium perenne. To determine whether MobC, a homologue of the STRIPAK complex component MOB3 in S. macrospora and N. crassa, is required for E. festucae hyphal fusion and symbiosis, a mobC deletion strain was generated. The DeltamobC mutant showed reduced rates of hyphal cell-cell fusion, formed intrahyphal hyphae and exhibited enhanced conidiation. Plants infected with DeltamobC were severely stunted. Hyphae of DeltamobC showed a proliferative pattern of growth within the leaves of Lolium perenne with increased colonization of the intercellular spaces and vascular bundles. Although hyphae were still able to form expressoria, structures allowing the colonization of the leaf surface, the frequency of formation was significantly reduced. Collectively, these results show that the STRIPAK component MobC is required for the establishment of a mutualistic symbiotic association between E. festucae and L. perenne, and plays an accessory role in the regulation of hyphal cell-cell fusion and expressorium development in E. festucae.","['Epichloe festucae', 'MobC', 'STRIPAK', 'endophyte', 'symbiosis']",Molecular plant pathology,New Zealand,2016 Dec
28330197,Xylitol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae overexpressing different xylose reductases using non-detoxified hemicellulosic hydrolysate of corncob.,"Xylitol production was compared in fed batch fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains overexpressing xylose reductase (XR) genes from Candida tropicalis, Pichia stipitis, Neurospora crassa, and an endogenous gene GRE3. The gene encoding a xylose specific transporter (SUT1) from P. stipitis was cloned to improve xylose transport and fed batch fermentation was used with glucose as a cosubstrate to regenerate NADPH. Xylitol yield was near theoretical for all the strains in fed batch fermentation. The highest volumetric (0.28 gL(-1) h(-1)) and specific (34 mgg(-1) h(-1)) xylitol productivities were obtained by the strain overexpressing GRE3 gene, while the control strain showed 7.2 mgg(-1) h(-1) specific productivity. The recombinant strains carrying XR from C. tropicalis, P. stipitis, and N. crassa produced xylitol with lower specific productivity of 14.3, 6.8, and 6.3 mgg(-1) h(-1), respectively, than GRE3 overexpressing strain. The glucose fed as cosubstrate was converted to biomass and ethanol, while xylose was only converted to xylitol. The efficiency of ethanol production was in the range of 38-45 % of the theoretical maximum for all the strains. Xylitol production from the non-detoxified corncob hemicellulosic hydrolysate by recombinant S. cerevisiae was reported for the first time. Xylitol productivity was found to be equivalent in the synthetic xylose as well as hemicellulosic hydrolysate-based media showing no inhibition on the S. cerevisiae due to the inhibitors present in the hydrolysate. A systematic evaluation of heterologous XRs and endogenous GRE3 genes was performed, and the strain overexpressing the endogenous GRE3 gene showed the best xylitol productivity.","['Corn cob hemicellulosic hydrolysate', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Xylitol', 'Xylose reductase']",3 Biotech,India,2016 Dec
26615739,"FvSO regulates vegetative hyphal fusion, asexual growth, fumonisin B1 production, and virulence in Fusarium verticillioides.","Hyphal anastomosis is a hallmark of filamentous fungi and plays vital roles including cellular homoeostasis, interhyphal communication and nutrient translocation. Here we identify a gene, FvSO, in Fusarium verticillioides, a filamentous ascomycete causing maize ear and stalk rot and producing fumonisin mycotoxins. FvSO, like its Neurospora crassa homologue SO, is required for vegetative hyphal fusion. It is also essential for normal vegetative growth, sporulation, and pathogenesis. FvSO encodes a predicted WW domain protein and shares 70 % protein sequence identity with N. crassa SO. FvSO deletion mutants (DeltaFvSO) had abnormal distribution of conidia size, and conidia of DeltaFvSO germinated much later and slower than wild type. DeltaFvSO was deficient in hyphal anastomosis, had slower radial growth and produced less fungal biomass than wild type. DeltaFvSO were unable to perform anastomosis, a key feature of filamentous fungi. Interestingly, production of fumonisin B1 by DeltaFvSO was significantly reduced compared to wild type. Additionally, DeltaFvSO was nonpathogenic to corn ears, stalks and seedlings, likely due to defective growth and development. In conclusion, FvSO is essential for vegetative hyphal fusion and is required for normal vegetative growth and sporulation, normal levels of fumonisin production and pathogenicity in F. verticillioides. The pleiotropic nature of DeltaFvSO phenotypes suggests that FvSO is likely involved in certain signalling pathways that regulate multiple cellular functions.","['Anastomosis', 'Conidiation', 'Maize ear rot', 'Microconidia', 'Stalk rot']",Fungal biology,USA,2015 Dec

Although we have substantial insight into the speciation histories of several important plant pathogens, we still know very little about the underlying genetics of reproductive isolation. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, and nonfungal model systems illustrate that reproductive barriers can evolve by different mechanisms, including genetic incompatibilities between neutral and adaptive substitutions, reinforcement selection, and chromosomal rearrangements. Advances in genome sequencing and sequence analyses provide a new framework to identify those traits that have driven the divergence of populations or caused reproductive isolation between species of fungal plant pathogens. These traits can be recognized based on signatures of strong divergent selection between species or through the association of allelic combination conferring hybrid inferiority. Comparative genome analyses also provide information about the contribution of genome rearrangements to speciation. This is particularly relevant for species of fungal pathogens with extreme levels of genomic rearrangements and within-species genome plasticity.","['evolutionary genomics', 'fungal plant pathogens', 'natural selection', 'population genomics', 'speciation']",The New phytologist,Germany,2013 Sep

In the first part, insights from transcriptomics analyses are described, with a focus on comparative transcriptomics. In the second part, examples of more detailed functional characterizations of the role of chromatin modifiers and/or transcription factors in several model organisms (Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, Sordaria macrospora, Coprinopsis cinerea, and Schizophyllum commune) that have led to a better understanding of regulatory networks at the level of chromatin structure and transcription are discussed.","['ascomycetes', 'basidiomycetes', 'chromatin', 'fruiting body formation', 'multicellular development', 'transcription factors', 'transcriptome']",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,Germany,2022 Dec 21

After initial and secondary screening, two hyper-producers strains S2 and N6 were selected for submerged fermentation and cultural conditions including temperature, pH, incubation period, inoculum size, substrate concentration, and different carbon and nitrogen sources were optimized for enzyme production. S2 strain showed maximum protease production of 3.291 U/mL after 14 days of incubation at 30  degrees C with 7 pH, 1% substrate concentration and 1 mL inoculum, While N6 strain showed maximum protease production of 1.929 U/mL under fermentation optimized conditions. Another aim of the present research was to underpin the biodiversity of genetics and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of protease DPAP (peptidyl-aminopeptidase) in Sordaria fimicola. Five polymorphic sites were observed in amino acid sequence of S. fimicola strains with reference to Neurospora crassa. PTMs prediction from bioinformatics tools predicted 38 phosphorylation sites on serine residues for protease peptidyl-aminopeptidase in S1 strain of S. fimicola while 45 phosphorylation sites on serine in N7 strain and 47 serine phosphorylation modifications were predicted in N. crassa. Current research gave an insight that change in genetic makeup effected PTMs which ultimately affected the production of protease enzyme in different strains of same organism (S. fimicola). The production and molecular data of the research revealed that environmental stress has strong effects on the specific genes through mutations which may cause genetic diversity.

We resynthesized an existing ROS sensor, called HyPer, to exhibit optimized codon bias for fungi, specifically Neurospora crassa, and used a combination of microscopy and plate reader assays to determine whether this construct could detect changes in fungal ROS during the plant infection process. Using confocal microscopy, we were able to visualize fluctuating ROS levels during the formation of an appressorium on an artificial hydrophobic surface, as well as during infection on host leaves. Using the plate reader, we were able to ascertain measurements of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) levels in conidia as detected by the MoHyPer sensor. Overall, by the optimization of codon usage for N. crassa and related fungal genomes, the MoHyPer sensor can be used as a robust, dynamic and powerful tool to both monitor and quantify H(2) O(2) dynamics in real time during important stages of the plant infection process.","['HyPer sensor', 'Magnaporthe oryzae', 'appressorium', 'codon bias', 'confocal imaging', 'reactive oxygen species', 'rice blast fungus']",Molecular plant pathology,USA,2017 Feb
24980894,SnowyOwl: accurate prediction of fungal genes by using RNA-Seq and homology information to select among ab initio models.,BACKGROUND: Locating the protein-coding genes in novel genomes is essential to understanding and exploiting the genomic information but it is still difficult to accurately predict all the genes. The recent availability of detailed information about transcript structure from high-throughput sequencing of messenger RNA (RNA-Seq) delineates many expressed genes and promises increased accuracy in gene prediction. Computational gene predictors have been intensively developed for and tested in well-studied animal genomes. Hundreds of fungal genomes are now or will soon be sequenced. The differences of fungal genomes from animal genomes and the phylogenetic sparsity of well-studied fungi call for gene-prediction tools tailored to them. RESULTS: SnowyOwl is a new gene prediction pipeline that uses RNA-Seq data to train and provide hints for the generation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based gene predictions and to evaluate the resulting models. The pipeline has been developed and streamlined by comparing its predictions to manually curated gene models in three fungal genomes and validated against the high-quality gene annotation of Neurospora crassa; SnowyOwl predicted N. crassa genes with 83% sensitivity and 65% specificity. SnowyOwl gains sensitivity by repeatedly running the HMM gene predictor Augustus with varied input parameters and selectivity by choosing the models with best homology to known proteins and best agreement with the RNA-Seq data. CONCLUSIONS: SnowyOwl efficiently uses RNA-Seq data to produce accurate gene models in both well-studied and novel fungal genomes.

23644150,conF and conJ contribute to conidia germination and stress response in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.,"Light induces various responses in fungi including formation of asexual and sexual reproductive structures. The formation of conidia in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans is regulated by red and blue light receptors. Expression of conidia associated con genes, which are widely spread in the fungal kingdom, increases upon exposure to light. We have characterized the light-inducible conF and conJ genes of A. nidulans which are homologs of con-6 and con-10 of Neurospora crassa. con genes are expressed during conidia formation in asexual development. Five minutes light exposure are sufficient to induce conF or conJ expression in vegetative mycelia. Similar to N. crassa there were no significant phenotypes of single con mutations. A double conF and conJ deletion resulted in significantly increased cellular amounts of glycerol or erythritol. This leads to a delayed germination phenotype combined with increased resistance against desiccation. These defects were rescued by complementation of the double mutant strain with either conF or conJ.

31212732,WC-1 and the Proximal GATA Sequence Mediate a Cis-/Trans-Acting Repressive Regulation of Light-Dependent Gene Transcription in the Dark.,"Light influences a wide range of physiological processes from prokaryotes to mammals. Neurospora crassa represents an important model system used for studying this signal pathway. At molecular levels, the WHITE COLLAR Complex (WCC), a heterodimer formed by WC-1 (the blue light photo-sensor) and WC-2 (the transcriptional activator), is the critical positive regulator of light-dependent gene expression. GATN (N indicates any other nucleotide) repeats are consensus sequences within the promoters of light-dependent genes recognized by the WCC. The distal GATN is also known as C-box since it is involved in the circadian clock. However, we know very little about the role of the proximal GATN, and the molecular mechanism that controls the transcription of light-induced genes during the dark/light transition it is still unclear. Here we showed a first indication that mutagenesis of the proximal GATA sequence within the target promoter of the albino-3 gene or deletion of the WC-1 zinc finger domain led to a rise in expression of light-dependent genes already in the dark, effectively decoupling light stimuli and transcriptional activation. This is the first observation of cis-/trans-acting repressive machinery, which is not consistent with the light-dependent regulatory mechanism observed in the eukaryotic world so far.","['GATA', 'WC-1', 'light responses', 'zinc finger']",International journal of molecular sciences,Switzerland. andreabrenna81@gmail.com,2019 Jun 12
28087943,RNA Interference in Fungi: Retention and Loss.,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism conserved in eukaryotes, including fungi, that represses gene expression by means of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) of about 20 to 30 nucleotides. Its discovery is one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the past 20 years, and it has revolutionized our perception of the functioning of the cell. Initially described and characterized in Neurospora crassa, the RNAi is widespread in fungi, suggesting that it plays important functions in the fungal kingdom. Several RNAi-related mechanisms for maintenance of genome integrity, particularly protection against exogenous nucleic acids such as mobile elements, have been described in several fungi, suggesting that this is the main function of RNAi in the fungal kingdom. However, an increasing number of fungal sRNAs with regulatory functions generated by specific RNAi pathways have been identified. Several mechanistic aspects of the biogenesis of these sRNAs are known, but their function in fungal development and physiology is scarce, except for remarkable examples such as Mucor circinelloides, in which specific sRNAs clearly regulate responses to environmental and endogenous signals. Despite the retention of RNAi in most species, some fungal groups and species lack an active RNAi mechanism, suggesting that its loss may provide some selective advantage. This article summarizes the current understanding of RNAi functions in the fungal kingdom.",?,Microbiology spectrum,Spain,2016 Dec
23954547,Investigation of the functional role of aldose 1-epimerase in engineered cellobiose utilization.,"Functional expression of a cellodextrin transporter and an intracellular beta-glucosidase from Neurospora crassa in Saccharomyces cerevisiae enables simultaneous co-fermentation of cellobiose and non-glucose sugars such as xylose. Here we investigate the functional role of aldose 1-epimerase (AEP) in engineered cellobiose utilization. One AEP (Gal10) and two putative AEPs (Yhr210c and Ynr071c sharing 50.6% and 51.0% amino acid identity with Gal10, respectively) were selected. Deletion of GAL10 led to complete loss of both AEP activity and cell growth on cellobiose, while GAL10 complementation restored the AEP activity and cell growth. In addition, deletion of YHR210C or YNR071C resulted in improved cellobiose utilization. These results suggest that the intracellular mutarotation of beta-glucose to alpha-glucose might be a rate controlling step and Gal10 play a crucial role in cellobiose fermentation by engineered S. cerevisiae.","['Aldose 1-epimerase', 'Cellobiose', 'Cellulosic ethanol', 'Mutarotase', 'beta-Glucosidase']",Journal of biotechnology,USA.

31954735,Molecular Regulation of Circadian Chromatin.,"Circadian rhythms are generated by transcriptional negative feedback loops and require histone modifications and chromatin remodeling to ensure appropriate timing and amplitude of clock gene expression. Circadian modifications to histones are important for transcriptional initiation and feedback inhibition serving as signaling platform for chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Current models indicate circadian-regulated facultative heterochromatin (CRFH) is a conserved mechanism at clock genes in Neurospora, Drosophila, and mice. CRFH consists of antiphasic rhythms in activating and repressive modifications generating chromatin states that cycle between transcriptionally permissive and nonpermissive. There are rhythms in histone H3 lysine 9 and 27 acetylation (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) and histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) during activation; while deacetylation, histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are hallmarks of repression. ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes control accessibility, nucleosome positioning/occupancy, and nuclear organization. In Neurospora, the rhythm in facultative heterochromatin is mediated by the frequency (frq) natural antisense transcript (NAT) qrf. While in mammals, histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase (KMT1/SUV39), and components of nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) are part of the nuclear PERIOD complex (PER complex). Genomics efforts have found relationships among rhythmic chromatin modifications at clock-controlled genes (ccg) revealing circadian control of genome-wide chromatin states. There are also circadian clock-regulated lncRNAs with an emerging function that includes assisting in chromatin dynamics. In this review, we explore the connections between circadian clock, chromatin remodeling, lncRNAs, and CRFH and how these impact rhythmicity, amplitude, period, and phase of circadian clock genes.","['aging', 'chromatin modifications', 'chromatin remodeling', 'circadian regulation', 'lncRNAs']",Journal of molecular biology,USA,2020 May 29
26032251,Nonoptimal codon usage influences protein structure in intrinsically disordered regions.,"Synonymous codons are not used with equal frequencies in most genomes. Codon usage has been proposed to play a role in regulating translation kinetics and co-translational protein folding. The relationship between codon usage and protein structures and the in vivo role of codon usage in eukaryotic protein folding is not clear. Here, we show that there is a strong codon usage bias in the filamentous fungus Neurospora. Importantly, we found genome-wide correlations between codon choices and predicted protein secondary structures: Nonoptimal codons are preferentially used in intrinsically disordered regions, and more optimal codons are used in structured domains. The functional importance of such correlations in vivo was confirmed by structure-based codon manipulation of codons in the Neurospora circadian clock gene frequency (frq). The codon optimization of the predicted disordered, but not well-structured regions of FRQ impairs clock function and altered FRQ structures. Furthermore, the correlations between codon usage and protein disorder tendency are conserved in other eukaryotes. Together, these results suggest that codon choices and protein structures co-evolve to ensure proper protein folding in eukaryotic organisms.",?,Molecular microbiology,USA,2015 Sep
31598902,Recognition motifs rather than phylogenetic origin influence the ability of targeting peptides to import nuclear-encoded recombinant proteins into rice mitochondria.,"Mitochondria fulfil essential functions in respiration and metabolism as well as regulating stress responses and apoptosis. Most native mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and are imported into mitochondria via one of several receptors that recognize N-terminal signal peptides. The targeting of recombinant proteins to mitochondria therefore requires the presence of an appropriate N-terminal peptide, but little is known about mitochondrial import in monocotyledonous plants such as rice (Oryza sativa). To gain insight into this phenomenon, we targeted nuclear-encoded enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to rice mitochondria using six mitochondrial pre-sequences with diverse phylogenetic origins, and investigated their effectiveness by immunoblot analysis as well as confocal and electron microscopy. We found that the ATPA and COX4 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), SU9 (Neurospora crassa), pFA (Arabidopsis thaliana) and OsSCSb (Oryza sativa) peptides successfully directed most of the eGFP to the mitochondria, whereas the MTS2 peptide (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) showed little or no evidence of targeting ability even though it is a native plant sequence. Our data therefore indicate that the presence of particular recognition motifs may be required for mitochondrial targeting, whereas the phylogenetic origin of the pre-sequences probably does not play a key role in the success of mitochondrial targeting in dedifferentiated rice callus and plants.","['Green fluorescent protein', 'Mitochondrial pre-sequence', 'Mitochondrial protein', 'Protein sorting', 'Subcellular targeting']",Transgenic research,Spain,2020 Feb
33714881,Multi-biological combined system: A mechanistic approach for removal of multiple heavy metals.,"In this work, interactions of diverse fungal species by the manipulation of cell concentrations has been utilized as the driving feature for the removal of hazardous multi-metals from the aqueous solutions. This study is focused on the exploitation of internal structures of microbes as a repository of lead (Pb(II)) and nickel (Ni(II)). For the concerned purpose 24 heavy metal resistant fungi are isolated from different industrial waste sites to form different microbial combinations as a single unit 'consortia' for achieving highest possible removal rates. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing are involved for the biochemical characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the screened isolates. The identification and screening studies reveal isolated strains as two Pb resistant fungi viz. K(1)SF-Pb15 (Aspergillus terreus) and SEF-Pb (Talaromyces islandicus) which have shown metal removal up to 93% and two Ni(II) tolerant fungal isolates namely, MEF-Ni-11 (Neurospora crassa) and Ni-1 (Aspergillus flavus) with removal efficiency of more than 91%. Relationship has been validated between the biosorption capacity and efficiency of the novel consortium under the influence of variable pH, time duration, initial concentration of Pb(II) and Ni(II), and inoculum size which has led to the foundation of effective and economical parameters for its exploitation in practical fields. The fungal consortia when applied on various industrial effluents has exhibited more than 95% of removal for both Pb(II) and Ni(II) simultaneously. The detailed mechanistic insight has shown the involvement of physical, chemical and ionic forces for the removal of heavy metals. So the designed novel multi-biological combined system acted as a repository for Pb(II) and Ni(II) ions with a greater potential which can be guided by the mechanistic methodology for the retrieval and remediation of multiple heavy metals from the real waste water samples.","['Biosorption capacity', 'Consortia', 'Fungi', 'Heavy metals']",Chemosphere,India,2021 Aug
28115989,"Identification and characterization of the glucose dual-affinity transport system in Neurospora crassa: pleiotropic roles in nutrient transport, signaling, and carbon catabolite repression.","BACKGROUND: The glucose dual-affinity transport system (low- and high-affinity) is a conserved strategy used by microorganisms to cope with natural fluctuations in nutrient availability in the environment. The glucose-sensing and uptake processes are believed to be tightly associated with cellulase expression regulation in cellulolytic fungi. However, both the identities and functions of the major molecular components of this evolutionarily conserved system in filamentous fungi remain elusive. Here, we systematically identified and characterized the components of the glucose dual-affinity transport system in the model fungus Neurospora crassa. RESULTS: Using RNA sequencing coupled with functional transport analyses, we assigned GLT-1 (K(m) = 18.42 +/- 3.38 mM) and HGT-1/-2 (K(m) = 16.13 +/- 0.95 and 98.97 +/- 22.02 microM) to the low- and high-affinity glucose transport systems, respectively. The high-affinity transporters hgt-1/-2 complemented a moderate growth defect under high glucose when glt-1 was deleted. Simultaneous deletion of hgt-1/-2 led to extensive derepression of genes for plant cell wall deconstruction in cells grown on cellulose. The suppression by HGT-1/-2 was connected to both carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A pathway. Alteration of a residue conserved across taxa in hexose transporters resulted in a loss of glucose-transporting function, whereas CCR signal transduction was retained, indicating dual functions for HGT-1/-2 as ""transceptors."" CONCLUSIONS: In this study, GLT-1 and HGT-1/-2 were identified as the key components of the glucose dual-affinity transport system, which plays diverse roles in glucose transport and carbon metabolism. Given the wide conservation of the glucose dual-affinity transport system across fungal species, the identification of its components and their pleiotropic roles in this study shed important new light on the molecular basis of nutrient transport, signaling, and plant cell wall degradation in fungi.","['Cellulase', 'Dual-affinity', 'GLT-1', 'Glucose transporter', 'HGT-1/-2', 'Signaling']",Biotechnology for biofuels,300308 China.

Compared with k-mer scheme, features developed here can alleviate the inherent curse of dimensionality in k-scheme once k becomes large. In addition, milRNApredictor built on novel features performs comparably to k-mer scheme, and achieves sensitivity of 74.21%, and specificity of 75.72% based on 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, for novel miRNA prediction, there exists high overlap of results from milRNApredictor and state-of-the-art mirnovo.

36814796,Genetic Biodiversity and Posttranslational Modifications of Protease Serine Endopeptidase in Different Strains of Sordaria fimicola.,"Genetic variations (mutation, crossing over, and recombination) act as a source for the gradual alternation in phenotype along a geographic transect where the environment changes. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) predicted modifications successfully in different and the same species of living organisms. Protein diversity of living organisms is predicted by PTMs. Environmental stresses change nucleotides to produce alternations in protein structures, and these alternations have been examined through bioinformatics tools. The goal of the current study is to search the diversity of genes and posttranslational modifications of protease serine endopeptidase in various strains of Sordaria fimicola. The S. fimicola's genomic DNA was utilized to magnify the protease serine endopeptidase (SP2) gene; the size of the product was 700 and 1400 base pairs. Neurospora crassa was taken as the reference strain for studying the multiple sequence alignment of the nucleotide sequence. Six polymorphic sites of six strains of S. fimicola with respect to N. crassa were under observation. Different bioinformatics tools, i.e., NetPhos 3.1, NetNES 1.1 Server, YinOYang1.2, and Mod Pred, to search phosphorylation sites, acetylation, nuclear export signals, O-glycosylation, and methylation, respectively, were used to predict PTMs. The findings of the current study were 35 phosphorylation sites on the residues of serine for protease SP2 in SFS and NFS strains of S. fimicola and N. crassa. The current study supported us to get the reality of genes involved in protease production in experimental fungi. Our study examined the genetic biodiversity in six strains of S. fimicola which were caused by stressful environments, and these variations are a strong reason for evolution. In this manuscript, we predicted posttranslational modifications of protease serine endopeptidase in S. fimicola obtained from different sites, for the first time, to see the effect of environmental stress on nucleotides, amino acids, and proteases and to study PTMs by using various bioinformatics tools. This research confirmed the genetic biodiversity and PTMs in six strains of S. fimicola, and the designed primers also provided strong evidence for the presence of protease serine endopeptidase in each strain of S. fimicola.",?,BioMed research international,Pakistan,2023
28721856,Repeat-Induced Point Mutation and Other Genome Defense Mechanisms in Fungi.,"Transposable elements have colonized the genomes of nearly all organisms, including fungi. Although transposable elements may sometimes provide beneficial functions to their hosts their overall impact is considered deleterious. As a result, the activity of transposable elements needs to be counterbalanced by the host genome defenses. In fungi, the primary genome defense mechanisms include repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) and methylation induced premeiotically, meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA, sex-induced silencing, cosuppression (also known as somatic quelling), and cotranscriptional RNA surveillance. Recent studies of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa have shown that the process of repeat recognition for RIP apparently involves interactions between coaligned double-stranded segments of chromosomal DNA. These studies have also shown that RIP can be mediated by the conserved pathway that establishes transcriptional (heterochromatic) silencing of repetitive DNA. In light of these new findings, RIP emerges as a specialized case of the general phenomenon of heterochromatic silencing of repetitive DNA.",?,Microbiology spectrum,MA 02138,2017 Jul

The cellular elements that fall under the regulation of the clock are often studied through the use of omics-scale data sets gathered over time to determine how circadian regulation impacts cellular physiology. Previously, we created the ECHO (Extended Circadian Harmonic Oscillator) tool to identify rhythms in these data sets. Using ECHO, we found that circadian oscillations widely undergo a change in amplitude over time and that these amplitude changes have a biological function in the cell. However, ECHO does not align gene ontologies with the identified oscillating genes to give functional context. Thus, we created ENCORE (ECHO Native Circadian Ontological Rhythmicity Explorer), a novel visualization tool which combines the disparate databases of Gene Ontologies, protein-protein interactions, and auxiliary information to uncover the meaning of circadianly-regulated genes. This freely-available tool performs automatic enrichment and creates publication-worthy visualizations which we used to extend previously-gathered data on circadian regulation of physiology from published omics-scale studies in three circadian model organisms: mouse, fruit fly, and Neurospora crassa.","['circadian rhythms', 'gene enrichment', 'gene expression', 'protein-protein interaction networks', 'proteomics', 'transcriptomics', 'visualizations']","ACM-BCB ... ... : the ...

However, the roles of its many co-chaperones in antifungal resistance are unknown. In this study, by susceptibility test of Neurospora crassa mutants lacking each of 18 Hsp90/Calcineurin system member genes (including 8 Hsp90 co-chaperone genes) to antifungal drugs and other stresses, we demonstrate that the Hsp90 co-chaperones Sti1 (Hop1 in yeast), Aha1, and P23 (Sba1 in yeast) were required for the basal resistance to antifungal azoles and heat stress. Deletion of any of them resulted in hypersensitivity to azoles and heat. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis showed that the toxic sterols eburicol and 14alpha-methyl-3,6-diol were significantly accumulated in the sti1 and p23 deletion mutants after ketoconazole treatment, which has been shown before to led to cell membrane stress. At the transcriptional level, Aha1, Sti1, and P23 positively regulate responses to ketoconazole stress by erg11 and erg6, key genes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Aha1, Sti1, and P23 are highly conserved in fungi, and sti1 and p23 deletion also increased the susceptibility to azoles in Fusarium verticillioides. These results indicate that Hsp90-cochaperones Aha1, Sti1, and P23 are critical for the basal azole resistance and could be potential targets for developing new antifungal agents.","['Hsp90', 'aha1', 'azole', 'co-chaperone', 'drug resistance', 'p23', 'sti1']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2016

Here we show that the chloroplast genome of the eukaryotic green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can be genetically engineered to produce xylitol through the introduction of a gene encoding a xylose reductase (XR) from the fungi Neurospora crassa. Increased levels of heterologous protein accumulation and xylitol production were achieved by synthesizing the XR gene in the chloroplast codon bias and by driving expression of the codon-optimized XR gene using a 16S/atpA promoter/5'-UTR fusion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering microalgae to produce xylitol, and show the importance of codon optimizing the XR gene and using the 16S/atpA promoter/5'-UTR fusion to express XR in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii.",?,Journal of biotechnology,USA,2013 Jun 10
36442111,Moderate activity of RNA chaperone maximizes the yield of self-spliced pre-RNA in vivo.,"CYT-19 is a DEAD-box protein whose adenosine-triphosphate (ATP)-dependent helicase activity facilitates the folding of group I introns in precursor RNA (pre-RNA) of Neurospora crassa (N. crassa). In the process, they consume a substantial amount of ATP. While much of the mechanistic insight into CYT-19 activity has been gained through the studies on the folding of Tetrahymena group I intron ribozyme, the more biologically relevant issue, namely the effect of CYT-19 on the self-splicing of pre-RNA, remains largely unexplored. Here, we employ a kinetic network model, based on the generalized iterative annealing mechanism (IAM), to investigate the relation between CYT-19 activity, rate of ribozyme folding, and the kinetics of the self-splicing reaction. The network rate parameters are extracted by analyzing the recent biochemical data for CYT-19-facilitated folding of Tetrahymena ribozyme. We then build extended models to explore the metabolism of pre-RNA. We show that the timescales of chaperone-mediated folding of group I ribozyme and self-splicing reaction compete with each other. As a consequence, in order to maximize the self-splicing yield of group I introns in pre-RNA, the chaperone activity must be sufficiently large to unfold the misfolded structures, but not too large to unfold the native structures prior to the self-splicing event. We discover that despite the promiscuous action on structured RNAs, the helicase activity of CYT-19 on group I ribozyme gives rise to self-splicing yields that are close to the maximum.","['ATP consumption', 'iterative annealing mechanism', 'kinetic partitioning mechanism', 'self-splicing activity', 'thermodynamic cost']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Korea,2022 Dec 6
28436325,Photoperiodic Responses and Characterization of the Cmvvd Gene Encoding a Blue Light Photoreceptor from the Medicinal Caterpillar Fungus Cordyceps militaris (Ascomycetes).,"Light is a necessary environmental factor for production of conidia and pigment, formation of stroma, and development of Cordyceps militaris, a well-known edible and medicinal mushroom. In this study, an obvious rhythm loop was observed in certain strains of C. militaris under conditions of alternating 12-hour intervals of dark and light. A possibly related gene, Cmvvd, the homologue of the blue-light photoreceptor of Neurospora crassa, was cloned from the genome of C. militaris. The protein CmVVD is predicted to be 203 amino acids in length and is characterized by the presence of a light, oxygen, or voltage domain. Analysis of the CmVVD sensor domain (light, oxygen, or voltage) suggested that it is a blue-light receptor. Cysteine 108 is essential for the in vivo function of VIVID (VVD) in N. crassa photoadaptation. However, proline is in this position instead in all of the tested CmVVD proteins, suggesting that CmVVD may have a different function or may function in ways different from VVD in N. crassa. Genetic variation analysis of CmVVD in 6 representative strains indicated that 3 informative sites exist. Cmvvd messenger RNA was able to be induced by light, and the expression level increased over 10 times after irradiation and was maintained at high levels in the nascent fruiting body. The light-induced expression of Cmvvd was abolished in Cmwc-1 mutants, suggesting that the expression of Cmvvd is dependent on the photoreceptor CmWC-1 or on a functional CmWC-1/WC-2 complex.

The evolutions of biomass, carotenoids, lipid production, compositions and contents of fatty acid and amino acid in Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were investigated under different light irradiation conditions. The results indicated that irradiation with 1700 lx could promote the growth and glucose assimilation of R. mucilaginosa, compared to the dark control, while the trial with 3500 lx had certain inhibiting effects. The carotenoids concentrations and percentages of unsaturated fatty acid (USFA, C16:1 and C18:1) increased with the improvement of irradiation intensity. Conversely, the proportions of saturated fatty acids (C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0) were decreased. The relative contents of amino acid and total protein were reduced under illumination compared to dark control. Conclusively, irradiation could change the cell growth and metabolites of the pigmented fungus, which implied that there may be a photoinduced mode exists in R. mucilaginosa similar to that of Neurospora crassa, and it also could be applied to regulate the biosynthesis and production of valuable components such as carotenoids and USFA.","['Growth characteristics', 'Light irradiation', 'Metabolites compositions', 'Regulation', 'Rhodotorula mucilaginosa']",Journal of food science and technology,730070 China.

27636014,Controlled Growth of Nanostructured Biotemplates with Cobalt and Nitrogen Codoping as a Binderless Lithium-Ion Battery Anode.,"Biomass can serve as a sustainable template for the synthesis of carbon materials but is limited by the intrinsic properties of the precursor organism. In this study we demonstrate that the properties of a fungal biotemplate can be tuned during cultivation, establishing a new electrode manufacturing process and ultimately improving the electrochemical performance of the biomass-derived electrode. More specifically, the carbon/nitrogen ratio of Neurospora crassa mycelia mats was shifted by 5-fold while generating cobalt nanoparticles into the hyphal structure originating from macroconidia spores. This shift was achieved through nitrate limitation and equal molar concentrations of Mg(2+) and Co(2+) in the growth media. The resulting mycelia mat was converted via a high-temperature pyrolysis process (800  degrees C) to produce a freestanding cobalt and nitrogen codoped electrode material with no postmodification. Ultimately, nitrogen doping resulted in one of the highest recorded specific reversible capacity for a freestanding biomass-derived lithium-ion anode (400 mAh g(-1) at C/10). We observed an additional improvement in capacity to 425 mAh g(-1) with the incorporation of 3 wt % Co. Our results show how shaping the chemical characteristics of an electrode during the growth of the biotemplate allows for sustainable carbon-based material manufacturing from a living (self-assembled) material.","['biotemplate', 'cobalt', 'filamentous fungi', 'lithium', 'nitrate']",ACS applied materials & interfaces,United States,2016 Oct 12
26335267,Paramutation phenomena in plants.,"Paramutation is a particular epigenetic phenomenon discovered in Zea mays by Alexander Brink in the 1950s, and then also found in other plants and animals. Brink coined the term paramutation (from the Greek syllable ""para"" meaning beside, near, beyond, aside) in 1958, with the aim to differentiate paramutation from mutation. The peculiarity of paramutation with respect to other gene silencing phenomena consists in the ability of the silenced allele (named paramutagenic) to silence the other allele (paramutable) present in trans. The newly silenced (paramutated) allele remains stable in the next generations even after segregation from the paramutagenic allele and acquires paramutagenic ability itself. The inheritance behaviour of these epialleles permits a fast diffusion of a particular gene expression level/phenotype in a population even in the absence of other evolutionary influences, thus breaking the Hardy-Weinberg law. As with other gene silencing phenomena such as quelling in the fungus Neurospora crassa, transvection in Drosophila, co-suppression and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) described in transgenic plants and RNA interference (RNAi) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, paramutation occurs without changes in the DNA sequence. So far the molecular basis of paramutation remains not fully understood, although many studies point to the involvement of RNA causing changes in DNA methylation and chromatin structure of the silenced genes. In this review I summarize all paramutation phenomena described in plants, focusing on the similarities and differences between them.","['Epigenetics', 'Gene silencing', 'Paramutation', 'Plants']",Seminars in cell & developmental biology,Italy.

Fungal genomics have higher potential to positively affect human health, environmental health, and the planet's stored energy. With a significant increase in sequenced fungal genomes, the known diversity of genes encoding organic acids, antibiotics, enzymes, and their pathways has increased exponentially. Currently, over a hundred fungal genome sequences are publicly available; however, no inclusive review has been published. This review is an initiative to address the significance of the fungal genome-sequencing program and provides the road map for basic and applied research.","['Bioenergy', 'biotechnology', 'database', 'fungus', 'gene', 'genome', 'pathogen']",Critical reviews in biotechnology,India,2016 Aug
34417614,Codon usage and protein length-dependent feedback from translation elongation regulates translation initiation and elongation speed.,"Essential cellular functions require efficient production of many large proteins but synthesis of large proteins encounters many obstacles in cells. Translational control is mostly known to be regulated at the initiation step. Whether translation elongation process can feedback to regulate initiation efficiency is unclear. Codon usage bias, a universal feature of all genomes, plays an important role in determining gene expression levels. Here, we discovered that there is a conserved but codon usage-dependent genome-wide negative correlation between protein abundance and CDS length. The codon usage effects on protein expression and ribosome flux on mRNAs are influenced by CDS length; optimal codon usage preferentially promotes production of large proteins. Translation of mRNAs with long CDS and non-optimal codon usage preferentially induces phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF2alpha, which inhibits translation initiation efficiency. Deletion of the eIF2alpha kinase CPC-3 (GCN2 homolog) in Neurospora preferentially up-regulates large proteins encoded by non-optimal codons. Surprisingly, CPC-3 also inhibits translation elongation rate in a codon usage and CDS length-dependent manner, resulting in slow elongation rates for long CDS mRNAs. Together, these results revealed a codon usage and CDS length-dependent feedback mechanism from translation elongation to regulate both translation initiation and elongation kinetics.",?,Nucleic acids research,USA,2021 Sep 20
28648778,DNA Replication Is Required for Circadian Clock Function by Regulating Rhythmic Nucleosome Composition.,"Although the coupling between circadian and cell cycles allows circadian clocks to gate cell division and DNA replication in many organisms, circadian clocks were thought to function independently of cell cycle. Here, we show that DNA replication is required for circadian clock function in Neurospora. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of DNA replication abolished both overt and molecular rhythmicities by repressing frequency (frq) gene transcription. DNA replication is essential for the rhythmic changes of nucleosome composition at the frq promoter. The FACT complex, known to be involved in histone disassembly/reassembly, is required for clock function and is recruited to the frq promoter in a replication-dependent manner to promote replacement of histone H2A.Z by H2A. Finally, deletion of H2A.Z uncoupled the dependence of the circadian clock on DNA replication. Together, these results establish circadian clock and cell cycle as interdependent coupled oscillators and identify DNA replication as a critical process in the circadian mechanism.","['DNA replication', 'cell cycle', 'circadian clock', 'histone H2A.Z', 'nucleosome composition']",Molecular cell,USA,2017 Jul 20
25254987,Neurospora WC-1 recruits SWI/SNF to remodel frequency and initiate a circadian cycle.,"In the negative feedback loop comprising the Neurospora circadian oscillator, the White Collar Complex (WCC) formed from White Collar-1 (WC-1) and White Collar-2 (WC-2) drives transcription of the circadian pacemaker gene frequency (frq). Although FRQ-dependent repression of WCC has been extensively studied, the mechanism by which the WCC initiates a circadian cycle remains elusive. Structure/function analysis of WC-1 eliminated domains previously thought to transactivate frq expression but instead identified amino acids 100-200 as essential for frq circadian expression. A proteomics-based search for coactivators with WCC uncovered the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable) complex: SWI/SNF interacts with WCC in vivo and in vitro, binds to the Clock box in the frq promoter, and is required both for circadian remodeling of nucleosomes at frq and for rhythmic frq expression; interestingly, SWI/SNF is not required for light-induced frq expression. These data suggest a model in which WC-1 recruits SWI/SNF to remodel and loop chromatin at frq, thereby activating frq expression to initiate the circadian cycle.",?,PLoS genetics,United States of America,2014 Sep
35550643,Uncovering in vivo biochemical patterns from time-series metabolic dynamics.,"System biology relies on holistic biomolecule measurements, and untangling biochemical networks requires time-series metabolomics profiling. With current metabolomic approaches, time-series measurements can be taken for hundreds of metabolic features, which decode underlying metabolic regulation. Such a metabolomic dataset is untargeted with most features unannotated and inaccessible to statistical analysis and computational modeling. The high dimensionality of the metabolic space also causes mechanistic modeling to be rather cumbersome computationally. We implemented a faster exploratory workflow to visualize and extract chemical and biochemical dependencies. Time-series metabolic features (about 300 for each dataset) were extracted by Ridge Tracking-based Extract (RTExtract) on measurements from continuous in vivo monitoring of metabolism by NMR (CIVM-NMR) in Neurospora crassa under different conditions. The metabolic profiles were then smoothed and projected into lower dimensions, enabling a comparison of metabolic trends in the cultures. Next, we expanded incomplete metabolite annotation using a correlation network. Lastly, we uncovered meaningful metabolic clusters by estimating dependencies between smoothed metabolic profiles. We thus sidestepped the processes of time-consuming mechanistic modeling, difficult global optimization, and labor-intensive annotation. Multiple clusters guided insights into central energy metabolism and membrane synthesis. Dense connections with glucose 1-phosphate indicated its central position in metabolism in N. crassa. Our approach was benchmarked on simulated random network dynamics and provides a novel exploratory approach to analyzing high-dimensional metabolic dynamics.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2022
35387072,Mitochondrial Transcription of Entomopathogenic Fungi Reveals Evolutionary Aspects of Mitogenomes.,"Entomopathogenic fungi and more specifically genera Beauveria and Metarhizium have been exploited for the biological control of pests. Genome analyses are important to understand better their mode of action and thus, improve their efficacy against their hosts. Until now, the sequences of their mitochondrial genomes were studied, but not at the level of transcription. Except of yeasts and Neurospora crassa, whose mt gene transcription is well described, in all other Ascomycota, i.e., Pezizomycotina, related information is extremely scarce. In this work, mt transcription and key enzymes of this function were studied. RT-PCR experiments and Northern hybridizations reveal the transcriptional map of the mt genomes of B. bassiana and M. brunneum species. The mt genes are transcribed in six main transcripts and undergo post-transcriptional modifications to create single gene transcripts. Promoters were determined in both mt genomes with a comparative in silico analysis, including all known information from other fungal mt genomes. The promoter consensus sequence is 5'-ATAGTTATTAT-3' which is in accordance with the definition of the polycistronic transcripts determined with the experiments described above. Moreover, 5'-RACE experiments in the case of premature polycistronic transcript nad1-nad4-atp8-atp6 revealed the 5' end of the RNA transcript immediately after the in silico determined promoter, as also found in other fungal species. Since several conserved elements were retrieved from these analyses compared to the already known data from yeasts and N. crassa, the phylogenetic analyses of mt RNA polymerase (Rpo41) and its transcriptional factor (Mtf1) were performed in order to define their evolution. As expected, it was found that fungal Rpo41 originate from the respective polymerase of T7/T3 phages, while the ancestor of Mtf1 is of alpha-proteobacterial origin. Therefore, this study presents insights about the fidelity of the mt single-subunit phage-like RNA polymerase during transcription, since the correct identification of mt promoters from Rpo41 requires an ortholog to bacterial sigma factor, i.e., Mtf1. Thus, a previously proposed hypothesis of a phage infected alpha-proteobacterium as the endosymbiotic progenitor of mitochondrion is confirmed in this study and further upgraded by the co-evolution of the bacterial (Mtf1) and viral (Rpo41) originated components in one functional unit.","['MTF1', 'RPO41', 'entomopathogenic fungi', 'mitochondrial (mt) transcription', 'mt RNA polymerase', 'mt promoters', 'mt transcription factor']",Frontiers in microbiology,Greece,2022
25141304,Exploring microRNA-like small RNAs in the filamentous fungus Fusarium oxysporum.,"RNA silencing such as quelling and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD) and several other classes of special small RNAs have been discovered in filamentous fungi recently. More than four different mechanisms of microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) production have been illustrated in the model fungus Neurospora crassa including a dicer-independent pathway. To date, very little work focusing on small RNAs in fungi has been reported and no universal or particular characteristic of milRNAs were defined clearly. In this study, small RNA and degradome libraries were constructed and subsequently deep sequenced for investigating milRNAs and their potential cleavage targets on the genome level in the filamentous fungus F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. As a result, there is no intersection of conserved miRNAs found by BLASTing against the miRBase. Further analysis showed that the small RNA population of F. oxysporum shared many common features with the small RNAs from N. crassa and other fungi. According to the known standards of miRNA prediction in plants and animals, milRNA candidates from 8 families (comprising 19 members) were screened out and identified. However, none of them could trigger target cleavage based on the degradome data. Moreover, most major signals of cleavage in transcripts could not match appropriate complementary small RNAs, suggesting that other predominant modes for milRNA-mediated gene regulation could exist in F. oxysporum. In addition, the PAREsnip program was utilized for comprehensive analysis and 3 families of small RNAs leading to transcript cleavage were experimentally validated. Altogether, our findings provided valuable information and important hints for better understanding the functions of the small RNAs and milRNAs in the fungal kingdom.",?,PloS one,China,2014
31536923,"Diversity and characterization of lignocellulolytic fungi isolated from oil palm empty fruit bunch, and identification of influencing factors of natural composting process.","Oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) is the most significant waste generated from the agricultural industry in Malaysia. Composting is one of the potential approaches to utilize EFB. However, composting of EFB is a time-consuming process, thus impractical for industrial application. The composting process can be shortened by introducing competent fungi into an optimal EFB composting system. This study was conducted to isolate and identify competent fungi that can naturally compost EFB. Samplings were carried out at eight different time points over a 20-weeks experimental period. The physical properties of EFB samples such as pH, residual oil content, and moisture content were measured and the EFB composting process that was indicated by the contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were assessed. The fungal growth, distribution, and lignocellulolytic enzyme activities were evaluated. The results indicated that the changes in physical properties of EFB were correlated to the fungal growth. The gradual reduction in moisture content and residual oil, and the increment in pH values in EFB samples throughout the experimental period resulted in reduced fungal growth and diversity. Such phenomenon delayed EFB composting process as revealed by the changes in EFB lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose contents. The most dominant and resilient fungi (Lichtheimia ramosa and Neurospora crassa) survived up to 16â€¯weeks and were capable of producing various lignocellulolytic enzymes. Further understanding of these factors that would contribute to effective EFB composting could be useful for future industrial applications.","['Cellulose', 'EFB', 'Hemicellulose', 'Lignin', 'Lignocellulolytic enzyme', 'Physical properties']","Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",Malaysia.

33174843,Optimized Vivid-derived Magnets photodimerizers for subcellular optogenetics in mammalian cells.,"Light-inducible dimerization protein modules enable precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in non-invasive fashion. Among them, Magnets are small modules engineered from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid by orthogonalizing the homodimerization interface into complementary heterodimers. Both Magnets components, which are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners, are photoreceptors requiring simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single excitation wavelength. However, Magnets require concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28 degrees C to be functional. Here we overcome these limitations by engineering an optimized Magnets pair requiring neither concatemerization nor low temperature preincubation. We validated these 'enhanced' Magnets (eMags) by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, to induce organelle contacts, and to reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism. eMags represent a very effective tool to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes.","['LOV domain', 'VAP', 'Vivid', 'cell biology', 'contact sites', 'human', 'light-dependent dimerizers', 'organelle contacts']",eLife,United States,2020 Nov 11
26124115,A circadian oscillator in the fungus Botrytis cinerea regulates virulence when infecting Arabidopsis thaliana.,"The circadian clock of the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana modulates defense mechanisms impacting plant-pathogen interactions. Nevertheless, the effect of clock regulation on pathogenic traits has not been explored in detail. Moreover, molecular description of clocks in pathogenic fungi--or fungi in general other than the model ascomycete Neurospora crassa--has been neglected, leaving this type of question largely unaddressed. We sought to characterize, therefore, the circadian system of the plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea to assess if such oscillatory machinery can modulate its virulence potential. Herein, we show the existence of a functional clock in B. cinerea, which shares similar components and circuitry with the Neurospora circadian system, although we found that its core negative clock element FREQUENCY (BcFRQ1) serves additional roles, suggesting extracircadian functions for this protein. We observe that the lesions produced by this necrotrophic fungus on Arabidopsis leaves are smaller when the interaction between these two organisms occurs at dawn. Remarkably, this effect does not depend solely on the plant clock, but instead largely relies on the pathogen circadian system. Genetic disruption of the B. cinerea oscillator by mutation, overexpression of BcFRQ1, or by suppression of its rhythmicity by constant light, abrogates circadian regulation of fungal virulence. By conducting experiments with out-of-phase light:dark cycles, we confirm that indeed, it is the fungal clock that plays the main role in defining the outcome of the Arabidopsis-Botrytis interaction, providing to our knowledge the first evidence of a microbial clock modulating pathogenic traits at specific times of the day.","['Arabidopsis thaliana', 'Botrytis cinerea', 'circadian clock', 'plant-pathogen interaction', 'virulence']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Chile,2015 Jul 14
31523495,"The RIPper, a web-based tool for genome-wide quantification of Repeat-Induced Point (RIP) mutations.","BACKGROUND: The RIPper (http://theripper.hawk.rocks) is a set of web-based tools designed for analyses of Repeat-Induced Point (RIP) mutations in the genome sequences of Ascomycota. The RIP pathway is a fungal genome defense mechanism that is aimed at identifying repeated and duplicated motifs, into which it then introduces cytosine to thymine transition mutations. RIP thus serves to deactivate and counteract the deleterious consequences of selfish or mobile DNA elements in fungal genomes. The occurrence, genetic context and frequency of RIP mutations are widely used to assess the activity of this pathway in genomic regions of interest. Here, we present a bioinformatics tool that is specifically fashioned to automate the investigation of changes in RIP product and substrate nucleotide frequencies in fungal genomes. RESULTS: We demonstrated the ability of The RIPper to detect the occurrence and extent of RIP mutations in known RIP affected sequences. Specifically, a sliding window approach was used to perform genome-wide RIP analysis on the genome assembly of Neurospora crassa. Additionally, fine-scale analysis with The RIPper showed that gene regions and transposable element sequences, previously determined to be affected by RIP, were indeed characterized by high frequencies of RIP mutations. Data generated using this software further showed that large proportions of the N. crassa genome constitutes RIP mutations with extensively affected regions displaying reduced GC content. The RIPper was further useful for investigating and visualizing changes in RIP mutations across the length of sequences of interest, allowing for fine-scale analyses. CONCLUSION: This software identified RIP targeted genomic regions and provided RIP statistics for an entire genome assembly, including the genomic proportion affected by RIP. Here, we present The RIPper as an efficient tool for genome-wide RIP analyses.","['Fine-scale RIP analyses', 'Genome-wide quantification', 'Large RIP affected regions', 'RIP', 'RIP profile', 'Repeat-Induced Point mutations', 'The RIPper', 'Web-based tool']",PeerJ,South Africa,2019
32038591,WHI-2 Regulates Intercellular Communication via a MAP Kinase Signaling Complex.,"The formation of the fungal mycelial network is facilitated by somatic cell fusion of germinating asexual spores (or germlings). Neurospora crassa germlings in close proximity display chemotropic growth that is dependent upon an intracellular network of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. Approximately 80 genes involved in intercellular communication and fusion have been identified, including three mutants with similar morphological phenotypes: Deltawhi-2, Deltacsp-6, and Deltaamph-1. Here we show that WHI-2 localizes to the cell periphery and regulates endocytosis, mitochondrial organization, sporulation, and cell fusion. WHI-2 was required to transduce signals through a conserved MAPK pathway (NRC-1/MEK-2/MAK-2) and target transcription factors (PP-1/ADV-1). The amph-1 locus encodes a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs domain-containing protein and mis-expression of whi-2 compensated for the cell fusion and endocytosis deficiencies of a Deltaamph-1 mutant. The csp-6 locus encodes a haloacid dehalogenase phosphatase whose activity was essential for cell fusion. Although fusion-deficient with themselves, cells that lacked whi-2, csp-6, or amph-1 showed a low frequency of chemotropic interactions with wild type cells. We hypothesize that WHI-2 could be important for signal perception during chemotropic interactions via a role in endocytosis.","['AMPH-1', 'CSP-6', 'MAPK', 'WHI-2', 'cell fusion', 'endocytosis']",Frontiers in microbiology,United States,2019
31711175,Deletion of bem46 retards spore germination and may be related to the polar growth of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Bud emergence 46 (BEM46), a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily, has been reported to be essential for polarized growth in Neurospora crassa. However, the role of BEM46 in aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) remains unclear. In this study, we constructed an A. fumigatus strain expressing BEM46 fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein, and a Deltabem46 mutant, to explore the localization and the role of growth of BEM46 in A. fumigatus, respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that BEM46 was dominantly expressed in the sites where hyphae germinated from conidia in A. fumigatus. When compared with the control strain, the Deltabem46 mutant exhibited insignificant morphological changes but delayed germination. No significant changes were found regarding the radial growth of both strains in response to various antifungal agents. These results suggest that BEM46 plays an essential role in timely germination in A. fumigatus. From the observation of fluorescence localization, we infer that that BEM46 might be involved in polarized growth in A. fumigatus.","['aspergillus fumigatus', 'bud emergence 46', 'germination', 'polarized growth']",Medical mycology,China,2020 Jul 1
29951038,Fungal Gene Mutation Analysis Elucidating Photoselective Enhancement of UV-C Disinfection Efficiency Toward Spoilage Agents on Fruit Surface.,"Short-wave ultraviolet (UV-C) treatment represents a potent, clean and safe substitute to chemical sanitizers for fresh fruit preservation. However, the dosage requirement for microbial disinfection may have negative effects on fruit quality. In this study, UV-C was found to be more efficient in killing spores of Botrytis cinerea in dark and red light conditions when compared to white and blue light. Loss of the blue light receptor gene Bcwcl1, a homolog of wc-1 in Neurospora crassa, led to hypersensitivity to UV-C in all light conditions tested. The expression of Bcuve1 and Bcphr1, which encode UV-damage endonuclease and photolyase, respectively, were strongly induced by white and blue light in a Bcwcl1-dependent manner. Gene mutation analyses of Bcuve1 and Bcphr1 indicated that they synergistically contribute to survival after UV-C treatment. In vivo assays showed that UV-C (1.0 kJ/m(2)) abolished decay in drop-inoculated fruit only if the UV-C treatment was followed by a dark period or red light, while in contrast, typical decay appeared on UV-C irradiated fruits exposed to white or blue light. In summary, blue light enhances UV-C resistance in B. cinerea by inducing expression of the UV damage repair-related enzymes, while the efficiency of UV-C application for fruit surface disinfection can be enhanced in dark or red light conditions; these principles seem to be well conserved among postharvest fungal pathogens.","['Botrytis cinerea', 'fungal pathogen', 'photoreceptor', 'postharvest decay', 'ultraviolet-C']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2018

Phylogenetic analysis revealed high level of divergence of sHSPs among filamentous fungi that orthologs could be only found between very closely related species. Strikingly, duplication of shsp genes occurred in genera Penicillium and also Aspergillus nidulans was observed, which might be an important pathway of sHSPs evolution. Expression analysis of shsp genes revealed that sHSPs were involved in response of A. nidulans to various conditions, including cold/heat as well as oxidative and osmotic stresses, and that the recent duplicated sHSPs in A. nidulans had highly similar function.","['Gene duplication', 'Heat shock protein', 'Orthologs', 'Stress response']",Gene,China,2016 Jan 10

24201891,Efficient formation of heterokaryotic sclerotia in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.,"Heterokaryon formation by hyphal fusion occurs during a sexual/parasexual cycle in filamentous fungi, and therefore, it is biotechnologically important for crossbreeding. In the industrial filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, a parasexual cycle has been reported, and it was recently suggested that sexual reproduction should be possible. However, as A. oryzae enters into hyphal fusion with a much lower frequency than Neurospora crassa, the process of heterokaryon formation has not been extensively characterized in A. oryzae. Here, we developed a detection system for heterokaryon formation by expressing red or green fluorescent proteins in nuclei and conferring uridine/uracil or adenine auxotrophy to MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 strains of A. oryzae. The heterokaryon formation of A. oryzae was investigated in paired culture using the genetically modified strains. No sclerotial formation was observed in the hyphal contact regions of the two strains with the same auxotrophy, whereas numerous sclerotia were formed between the strains with different auxotrophies. In most of the formed sclerotia, the uridine/uracil and adenine auxotrophies were complemented, and both red and green fluorescence were detected, indicating that heterokaryotic fusants were formed by hyphal fusion before or during sclerotial formation. Moreover, overexpressing the sclR gene, which encodes a transcription factor promoting sclerotial formation, increased the number of heterokaryotic sclerotia formed between the two auxotrophic strains. Notably, these effects in sclerotial formation of heterokaryotic fusants were observed independently of the mating type pairing combinations. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that paring of different auxotrophs and sclR overexpression promote the formation of heterokaryotic sclerotia in A. oryzae.",?,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,Japan,2014 Jan
23873862,Synchronous activation of cell division by light or temperature stimuli in the dimorphic yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus.,"Many fungi respond to light and regulate fungal development and behavior. A blue light-activated complex has been identified in Neurospora crassa as the product of the wc-1 and wc-2 genes. Orthologs of WC-1 and WC-2 have hitherto been found only in filamentous fungi and not in yeast, with the exception of the basidiomycete pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus. Here, we report that the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus responds to blue light depending on Wcs1 and Wcs2, orthologs of components of the WC complex. Surprisingly, those of ascomycete S. japonicus are more closely related to those of the basidiomycete. S. japonicus reversibly changes from yeast to hyphae in response to environmental stresses. After incubation at 30 degrees C, a colony of yeast was formed, and then hyphal cells extended from the periphery of the colony. When light cycles were applied, distinct dark- and bright-colored hyphal cell stripes were formed because the growing hyphal cells had synchronously activated cytokinesis. In addition, temperature cycles of 30 degrees C for 12 h and 35 degrees C for 12 h or of 25 degrees C for 12 h and 30 degrees C for 12 h during incubation in the dark induced a response in the hyphal cells similar to that of light. The stripe formation of the temperature cycles was independent of the wcs genes. Both light and temperature, which are daily external cues, have the same effect on growing hyphal cells. A dual sensing mechanism of external cues allows organisms to adapt to daily changes of environmental alteration.",?,Eukaryotic cell,Japan,2013 Sep
29491936,Expanding the phenotypic plasticity paradigm to broader views of trait space and ecological function.,"Foundational concepts of trait spaces, including phenotypic plasticity and function of traits, should be expanded and better integrated with ecological theory. This article addresses two areas where plasticity theory can become further integrated with ecological, evolutionary, and developmental thinking. First is the idea that not only trait means within environments and plasticity of trait means across environments is optimized by selection, but that the entire shape of phenotype distributions such as variance or skew should be optimized within and across environments. In order for trait distribution shape to evolve into adaptations, there must be a genetic basis for and selection upon variation in distribution shapes and their plasticities. I present published and new data demonstrating genetic control and selection for higher moments of phenotype distributions; though, plasticity in these values has not yet been tested. Genetic control of phenotype distribution moments is shown for Neurospora crassa ascospore size and shape. Selection on trait distribution moments is shown for Eurosta solidaginis gall size. Second, there is a tradition in modeling plasticity as an adaptive strategy that pits it as an alternative to ecological specialization or generalization. However, these strategies need not be considered alternatives. Rather, with environmental fluctuation within generations plasticity may produce additive or non-additive intermediate (generalist) phenotypes, or something new altogether. I present published and new data on the snail Physa virgata and fish Gambusia affinis that show plasticity produces partly intermediate (generalist) and partly unique phenotypic elements in mixed and fluctuating environments. Plasticity can thus be viewed in the context of a broader trait space and as having broader ecological roles than currently is conceived.","['genetics of trait distributions', 'multi-moment reaction norms', 'non-additive plasticity', 'off-plane phenotypes', 'probabilistic optimization', 'selection on trait distributions', 'specialists and generalists.']",Current zoology,USA,2016 Oct
25506342,Nitrogen regulation of fungal secondary metabolism in fungi.,"Fungi occupy diverse environments where they are constantly challenged by stressors such as extreme pH, temperature, UV exposure, and nutrient deprivation. Nitrogen is an essential requirement for growth, and the ability to metabolize a wide variety of nitrogen sources enables fungi to colonize different environmental niches and survive nutrient limitations. Favored nitrogen sources, particularly ammonium and glutamine, are used preferentially, while the expression of genes required for the use of various secondary nitrogen sources is subject to a regulatory mechanism called nitrogen metabolite repression. Studies on gene regulation in response to nitrogen availability were carried out first in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus nidulans, and Neurospora crassa. These studies revealed that fungi respond to changes in nitrogen availability with physiological and morphological alterations and activation of differentiation processes. In all fungal species studied, the major GATA transcription factor AreA and its co-repressor Nmr are central players of the nitrogen regulatory network. In addition to growth and development, the quality and quantity of nitrogen also affects the formation of a broad range of secondary metabolites (SMs). Recent studies, mainly on species of the genus Fusarium, revealed that AreA does not only regulate a large set of nitrogen catabolic genes, but can also be involved in regulating production of SMs. Furthermore, several other regulators, e.g., a second GATA transcription factor, AreB, that was proposed to negatively control nitrogen catabolic genes by competing with AreA for binding to GATA elements, was shown to act as activator of some nitrogen-repressed as well as nitrogen-induced SM gene clusters. This review highlights our latest understanding of canonical (AreA-dependent) and non-canonical nitrogen regulation mechanisms by which fungi may regulate biosynthesis of certain SMs in response to nitrogen availability.","['AreA', 'AreB', 'GS', 'MeaB', 'Nmr1', 'nitrogen regulation', 'secondary metabolites']",Frontiers in microbiology,Germany,2014

Such modifications can thus influence stability and biochemical activities of the proteins, activity and stability of their upstream targets within specific signalling pathways. Commonly used mathematical tools for such protein-protein (and/or protein-mRNA) interactions in single cells, namely, Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics, yielding a system of ordinary differential equations, are extended here into (non-linear) partial differential equations by taking into account a more realistic spatial representation of the environment where these reactions occur. In the modelling framework under consideration, all interactions occur in a cell divided into two compartments, the nucleus and the cytoplasm, connected by the semipermeable nuclear membrane and bounded by the impermeable cell membrane. Passive transport mechanism, modelled by the so-called Kedem-Katchalsky boundary conditions, is used here to represent migration of species throughout the nuclear membrane. Nonlinear systems of partial differential equations are solved by the semi-implicit Rothe method. Examples of two spatial oscillators are shown. Namely, these are the circadian rhythm for concentration of the FRQ protein in Neurospora crassa and oscillatory dynamics observed in the activation and regulation of the p53 protein following DNA damage in mammalian cells.","['Hill kinetics', 'Intracellular protein signalling', 'Leloup-Goldbeter FRQ model', 'Michaelis-Menten kinetics', 'Oscillations', 'Reaction-diffusion PDE models', 'Spatial representation', 'p53']",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,France,2014 Jun
25108509,Two pentatricopeptide repeat domain proteins are required for the synthesis of respiratory complex I.,"In this study pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins in filamentous ascomycetes are identified and functionally characterized. PPR proteins, which have in common a degenerated 35 amino acid motif often arranged in multiple tandems, are known to be implicated in various steps of RNA metabolism in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In filamentous ascomycetes we identified a common set of nine PPR proteins. For seven of these proteins, which were not yet characterized, knockout mutants of Neurospora crassa were analyzed. The knockout of three genes appeared to be lethal while four mutants showed different degrees of alterations in respiratory chain complexes. Two mutants are specifically affected in the assembly of a functional complex I while the other enzymes of the respiratory chain are present. Both mutants demonstrate the presence of a peripheral arm and the absence of a detectable membrane arm.

34086938,Discovery of 17 conserved structural RNAs in fungi.,"Many non-coding RNAs with known functions are structurally conserved: their intramolecular secondary and tertiary interactions are maintained across evolutionary time. Consequently, the presence of conserved structure in multiple sequence alignments can be used to identify candidate functional non-coding RNAs. Here, we present a bioinformatics method that couples iterative homology search with covariation analysis to assess whether a genomic region has evidence of conserved RNA structure. We used this method to examine all unannotated regions of five well-studied fungal genomes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe). We identified 17 novel structurally conserved non-coding RNA candidates, which include four H/ACA box small nucleolar RNAs, four intergenic RNAs and nine RNA structures located within the introns and untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. For the two structures in the 3' UTRs of the metabolic genes GLY1 and MET13, we performed experiments that provide evidence against them being eukaryotic riboswitches.",?,Nucleic acids research,USA,2021 Jun 21
27347834,Light governs asexual differentiation in the grey mould fungus Botrytis cinerea via the putative transcription factor BcLTF2.,"Botrytis cinerea is a plant pathogenic fungus known for its utilization of light as environmental cue to regulate asexual differentiation: conidia are formed in the light, while sclerotia are formed in the dark. As no orthologues of known regulators of conidiation (e.g., Aspergillus nidulans BrlA, Neurospora crassa FL) exist in the Leotiomycetes, we initiated a de novo approach to identify the functional counterpart in B. cinerea. The search revealed the light-responsive C2H2 transcription factor BcLTF2 whose expression - usually restricted to light conditions - is necessary and sufficient to induce conidiation and simultaneously to suppress sclerotial development. Light-induced expression of bcltf2 is mediated via a so far unknown pathway, and is attenuated in a (blue) light-dependent fashion by the White Collar complex, BcLTF1 and the VELVET complex. Mutation of either component leads to increased bcltf2 expression and causes light-independent conidiation (always conidia phenotype). Hence, the tight regulation of bcltf2 governs the balance between vegetative growth that allows for the colonization of the substrate and subsequent reproduction via conidia in the light. The orthologue ssltf2 in the closely related species Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is not significantly expressed suggesting that its deregulation may cause the lack of the conidiation program in this fungus.",?,Environmental microbiology,Germany,2016 Nov

35330770,Characterization of Vegetative Incompatibility in Morchella importuna and Location of the Related-Genes by Bulk Segregant Analysis.,"Vegetative incompatibility (VI) is a widespread phenomenon developed in Morchella importuna, a species of ascomycete fungus that is cultivated on a rapidly expanding scale in China. Understanding the genetic bases of this nonself-recognition phenomenon is beneficial for resolving some problems that are associated with the production of this highly prized edible fungus, such as crossbreeding, strain classification, and pathogen transmission. VI is genetically controlled by het genes, organized in two different systems, namely allelic and nonallelic. These het genes have been well characterized in Podospora anserina and Neurospora crassa. In this work, putative het-homologs were identified in the genome of M. importuna, but their low allelic polymorphism in different vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) suggested that VI in this fungus might not be regulated by these het genes. The progeny derived from vegetative compatible parents became a VCG, while the single-ascospore strains from vegetative incompatible parents were divided into four VCGs, and the interaction between the inter-group strains led to the formation of two types of barrages, viz., thin dark line and raised aggregate of hyphae. The Bulk Segregant Analysis confirmed that the genes mimpvic32 and mimpvic33 were linked to VI reactions in M. importuna; nevertheless, the formation of barrages also occurred between the pairs carrying the same allele of these two genes. In sum, the VI control system in M. importuna was complicated, and there were more other allelic or non-allelic VI-related genes.","['allelic polymorphism', 'ascomycete', 'barrage', 'het gene', 'vegetative compatibility group']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2022

29515539,Identification of Key Residues for Enzymatic Carboxylate Reduction.,"Carboxylate reductases (CARs, E.C. 1.2.1.30) generate aldehydes from their corresponding carboxylic acid with high selectivity. Little is known about the structure of CARs and their catalytically important amino acid residues. The identification of key residues for carboxylate reduction provides a starting point to gain deeper understanding of enzymatic carboxylate reduction. A multiple sequence alignment of CARs with confirmed activity recently identified in our lab and from the literature revealed a fingerprint of conserved amino acids. We studied the function of conserved residues by multiple sequence alignments and mutational replacements of these residues. In this study, single-site alanine variants of Neurospora crassa CAR were investigated to determine the contribution of conserved residues to the function, expressability or stability of the enzyme. The effect of amino acid replacements was investigated by analyzing enzymatic activity of the variants in vivo and in vitro. Supported by molecular modeling, we interpreted that five of these residues are essential for catalytic activity, or substrate and co-substrate binding. We identified amino acid residues having significant impact on CAR activity. Replacement of His 237, Glu 433, Ser 595, Tyr 844, and Lys 848 by Ala abolish CAR activity, indicating their key role in acid reduction. These results may assist in the functional annotation of CAR coding genes in genomic databases. While some other conserved residues decreased activity or had no significant impact, four residues increased the specific activity of NcCAR variants when replaced by alanine. Finally, we showed that NcCAR wild-type and mutants efficiently reduce aliphatic acids.","['aldehyde', 'biocatalysis', 'carboxylate reductase', 'flavor and fragrance', 'pharmaceutical intermediate', 'signature sequence']",Frontiers in microbiology,Austria,2018
28007213,The Woronin body in the nematophagous fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora is essential for trap formation and efficient pathogenesis.,"The Woronin body is a unique organelle in Pezizomycotina species. Following the injury of hyphae, it can quickly seal the septal pores to reduce the loss of cytoplasm and promote hyphal healing. The Woronin body is also considered a significant factor in efficient pathogenesis in many fungal pathogens. In this study, we identified AoHex1, a homologue of Neurospora crassa Hex1, a main component of the Woronin body in the genome of the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora. To study the biological function of the AoHex1 gene, the gene was deleted and its phenotypes assessed. Inactivation of this gene led to the loss of the Woronin body. The DeltaAoHex1 strain showed compromised growth rate, conidiation, and anti-stress abilities. Moreover, trap formation was completely absent in the mutant strain, which could no longer capture nematodes. Our results suggest that the Woronin body plays an important role in growth, conidiation, anti-stress, trap formation, and virulence against nematodes in A. oligospora.","['AoHex1', 'Bio-control', 'Nematode-trapping fungus']",Fungal biology,China,2017 Jan

23991062,Aspergillus oryzae AoSO is a novel component of stress granules upon heat stress in filamentous fungi.,"Stress granules are a type of cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granule formed in response to the inhibition of translation initiation, which typically occurs when cells are exposed to stress. Stress granules are conserved in eukaryotes; however, in filamentous fungi, including Aspergillus oryzae, stress granules have not yet been defined. For this reason, here we investigated the formation and localization of stress granules in A. oryzae cells exposed to various stresses using an EGFP fusion protein of AoPab1, a homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pab1p, as a stress granule marker. Localization analysis showed that AoPab1 was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions, and accumulated as cytoplasmic foci mainly at the hyphal tip in response to stress. AoSO, a homolog of Neurospora crassa SO, which is necessary for hyphal fusion, colocalized with stress granules in cells exposed to heat stress. The formation of cytoplasmic foci of AoSO was blocked by treatment with cycloheximide, a known inhibitor of stress granule formation. Deletion of the Aoso gene had effects on the formation and localization of stress granules in response to heat stress. Our results suggest that AoSO is a novel component of stress granules specific to filamentous fungi.

High temperature daqu can form three typical microecologies during the preparation process, making it an ideal system for studying chameleon-like microbes. This study integrated multi-omic methods such as metaproteomics, and determined that Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, Bacillus subtilis and Oceanobacillus iheyensis were chameleon-like microbes that regulated the metabolic differences of five-member heterocyclic amino acids in daqu, resulting in microecological differentiation. Synthetic microbial consortia consisting of the four chameleon-like microbes with (T6) and without (T4) the dominant functional bacteria Saccharopolyspora erythraea and Virgibacillus haloimitrificans were fermented under simulated in situ conditions. The community constructed by microorganisms with greater functional diversity (T6) was more robust, and its metabolome was more similar to the in situ system. When exposed to environmental disturbances, the functional diversity helped to maintain the community stability by increasing the dissimilarity of chameleon-like microbes in the community and forming different homeostasis.","['Chameleon-like microbes', 'High temperature daqu', 'Meta-omics', 'Synthetic microbial community']",Food microbiology,China,2023 Feb

Based on the sequences involved in alternative splicing found in Neurospora crassa, we identified unique sequences that are thought to play a role in the alternative splicing of the thiA riboswitch. Based on the mechanism of alternative splicing regulated by the thiA riboswitch, we constructed a new TPP-dependent artificial riboswitch, which unlike the wild-type riboswitch, promotes, rather than inhibits, gene expression. We found that a target gene controlled by this turn-on artificial riboswitch can be sufficiently expressed for practical use in A. oryzae.

32218793,The Q-System as a Synthetic Transcriptional Regulator in Plants.,"A primary focus of the rapidly growing field of plant synthetic biology is to develop technologies to precisely regulate gene expression and engineer complex genetic circuits into plant chassis. At present, there are few orthogonal tools available for effectively controlling gene expression in plants, with most researchers instead using a limited set of viral elements or truncated native promoters. A powerful repressible-and engineerable-binary system that has been repurposed in a variety of eukaryotic systems is the Q-system from Neurospora crassa. Here, we demonstrate the functionality of the Q-system in plants through transient expression in soybean (Glycine max) protoplasts and agroinfiltration in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Further, using functional variants of the QF transcriptional activator, it was possible to modulate the expression of reporter genes and to fully suppress the system through expression of the QS repressor. As a potential application for plant-based biosensors (phytosensors), we demonstrated the ability of the Q-system to amplify the signal from a weak promoter, enabling remote detection of a fluorescent reporter that was previously undetectable. In addition, we demonstrated that it was possible to coordinate the expression of multiple genes through the expression of a single QF activator. Based on the results from this study, the Q-system represents a powerful orthogonal tool for precise control of gene expression in plants, with envisioned applications in metabolic engineering, phytosensors, and biotic and abiotic stress tolerance.","['Q-system', 'gene expression', 'genetic circuits', 'metabolic engineering', 'plant synthetic biology']",Frontiers in plant science,United States,2020

Methylation of lysine 9 at histone H3 (H3K9me) is critical for regulating chromatin structure and gene transcription. Dim5 is a lysine histone methyltransferase (KHMTase) enzyme, which is responsible for the methylation of H3K9 in eukaryotes. In the current study, we identified a single ortholog of Neurospora crassa Dim5 in Fusarium verticillioides. In this study, we report that FvDim5 regulates the trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3). The FvDIM5 deletion mutant (DeltaFvDim5) showed significant defects in conidiation, perithecium production and fungal virulence.

28322269,A Ras GTPase associated protein is involved in the phototropic and circadian photobiology responses in fungi.,"Light is an environmental signal perceived by most eukaryotic organisms and that can have major impacts on their growth and development. The MadC protein in the fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus (Mucoromycotina) has been postulated to form part of the photosensory input for phototropism of the fruiting body sporangiophores, but the madC gene has remained unidentified since the 1960s when madC mutants were first isolated. In this study the madC gene was identified by positional cloning. All madC mutant strains contain loss-of-function point mutations within a gene predicted to encode a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Ras. The madC gene complements the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras-GAP ira1 mutant and the encoded MadC protein interacts with P. blakesleeanus Ras homologs in yeast two-hybrid assays, indicating that MadC is a regulator of Ras signaling. Deletion of the homolog in the filamentous ascomycete Neurospora crassa affects the circadian clock output, yielding a pattern of asexual conidiation similar to a ras-1 mutant that is used in circadian studies in N. crassa. Thus, MadC is unlikely to be a photosensor, yet is a fundamental link in the photoresponses from blue light perceived by the conserved White Collar complex with Ras signaling in two distantly-related filamentous fungal species.",?,Scientific reports,USA,2017 Mar 21
24184384,Molecular cloning and expression of fungal cellobiose transporters and beta-glucosidases conferring efficient cellobiose fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Cellobiose was once regarded as a byproduct that should be removed from biomass hydrolysates because of its inhibitory activity to cellulases. It was revealed, however, that cellobiose could serve as a co-substrate for xylose fermentation by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite its advantages, to date, little is known about cellodextrin transporters that endow S. cerevisiae with cellobiose transporting ability. In this study, engineered S. cerevisiae strains capable of fermenting cellobiose were constructed by expressing various fungal cellobiose transporters and intracellular beta-glucosidases. Among them, the strain expressing a putative sugar transporter from Penicillium chrysogenum (Pc_ST) and beta-glucosidase from Thielavia terrestris (Tt_BG) showed an improved cellobiose fermentation performance compared to the strain expressing a cellodextrin transporter from Neurospora crassa (Nc_CDT-1) and beta-glucosidase from N. crassa (Nc_GH1-1). Cellobiose fermentation by S. cerevisiae Pc_ST/Tt_BG under microaerobic conditions resulted in 14.5+/-0.5g/L of final ethanol concentration with a yield of 0.37+/-0.01g ethanol/g cellobiose, which are 22% and 26% higher than the corresponding values of S. cerevisiae Nc_CDT-1/Nc_GH1-1. These results suggest that the yield and rate of cellobiose fermentation can be improved by adopting optimal pairs of cellobiose transporters and beta-glucosidase.","['Cellobiose fermentation', 'Cellodextrin transporter', 'Ethanol', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'beta-glucosidase']",Journal of biotechnology,Republic of Korea,2014 Jan
31714697,The The TOB/SAM complex composition in mitochondria of Dictyostelium discoideum during progression from unicellularity to multicellularity.,"Despite its complex life cycle including unicellular and multicellular stages, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, a well-known model in biomedical research, has not been used as a model organism in studies on mitochondrial import, including its significance in cellular processes. Moreover, data concerning mitochondrial protein import machinery in D. discoideum mitochondria is limited and nothing is known about the impact of that machinery on slime mold life cycle. Here, we focused on the TOB/SAM (topogenesis of the mitochondrial outer membrane beta-barrel proteins/sorting and assembly machinery) complex. This complex is localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane and is indispensable for the formation of metabolite exchange and protein import pathways in the membrane, and substantially contributes to the regulation of mitochondrial morphology and distribution. Furthermore, the available data suggests that the TOB/SAM complex variants differ between mitochondria of multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes. Therefore, we decided to determine these variants of the TOB/SAM in mitochondria of D. discoideum progressing from single cells to early multicellular stages, when the cells stream together to form a multicellular organism. The results revealed two complex variants of the TOB/SAM complex of about 160 and 600 kDa molecular weight, present in mitochondria of D. discoideum cells at the studied stages. The discussed complex variants resemble the ones that have been already detected for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fungus Neurospora crassa and human cells, and one of investigated variants differentiates unicellular and initial multicellular stages of the D. discoideum life cycle.",?,Acta biochimica Polonica,Poland,2019 Nov 12
30238672,Structural Features on the Substrate-Binding Surface of Fungal Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases Determine Their Oxidative Regioselectivity.,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-dependent enzymes that oxidatively cleave many of nature's most recalcitrant polysaccharides by acting on the C1- and/or C4-carbon of the glycosidic bond. Here, the results of an extensive mutagenesis study on three LPMO representatives, Phanerochaete chrysosporium LPMO9D (C1-oxidizer), Neurospora crassa LPMO9C (C4), and Hypocrea jecorina LPMO9A (C1/C4), are reported. Using a previously published indicator diagram, the authors demonstrate that several structural determinants of LPMOs play an important role in their oxidative regioselectivity. N-glycan removal and alterations of the aromatic residues on the substrate-binding surface are shown to alter C1/C4-oxidation ratios. Removing the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) is found not to alter the regioselectivity of HjLPMO9A, although the effect of mutational changes is shown to increase in a CBM-free context. The accessibility to the solvent-exposed axial position of the copper-site reveales not to be a major regioselectivity indicator, at least not in PcLPMO9D. Interestingly, a HjLPMO9A variant lacking two surface exposed aromatic residues combines decreased binding capacity with a 22% increase in synergetic efficiency. Similarly to recent LPMO10 findings, our results suggest a complex matrix of surface-interactions that enables LPMO9s not only to bind their substrate, but also to accurately direct their oxidative force.","['Pichia pastoris', 'enzyme engineering', 'lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase', 'oxidative regioselectivity']",Biotechnology journal,Belgium,2019 Mar

To enhance the GRF in Monascus ruber M7, we deleted the Mrlig4 gene encoding a homolog of N. crassa DNA ligase IV. The obtained mutant (MrDeltalig4) showed no apparent defects in vegetative growth, colony phenotype, microscopic morphology, spore yield, and production of Monascus pigments and citrinin compared with the wild-type strain (M. ruber M7). Gene targeting of ku70 and triA genes revealed that GRF in the MrDeltalig4 strain increased four-fold compared with that in the wild-type strain, reached 68 % and 85 %, respectively. Thus, the MrDeltalig4 strain is a promising host for efficient genetic manipulation.

However, their analysis remains challenging due to the several steps involved for their extractions and purifications prior to mass spectrometric analysis. To address this challenge, we developed a rapid and sensitive method to identify GIPCs from the four common fungal plant pathogens Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium graminearium, Neurospora crassa and Ustilago maydis. METHODS: Fungal plant pathogens were cultured, harvested, heat-inactivated and washed three times with double-distilled water. Intact fungi were deposited on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) target plate, mixed with the matrix consisting of a 9:1 mixture of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid solubilized at 10 mg/mL in chloroform-methanol (9:1 v/v) and analyzed using a Bruker MALDI Biotyper Sirius system in the linear negative ion mode. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 700 to 2000. RESULTS: MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometric analysis of cultured fungi showed clear signature of GIPCs in B. cinerea, F. graminearium, N. crassa and U. maydis. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that routine MALDI-TOF in the linear negative ion mode combined with an apolar solvent system to solubilize the matrix is applicable to the detection of filamentous fungal GIPCs.",?,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,UK,2020 Nov 30

Fungal species form a large group of eukaryotic organisms, and their GlpFs may be diverse, exhibiting various activities. However, few filamentous fungal GlpFs have been biologically investigated. Here, a glpF gene from the halophilic fungus Aspergillus glaucus (AgglpF) was verified to be a channel of water or glycerol in Xenopus laevis oocytes and was further functionally analyzed in three heterologous systems. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cells overexpressing AgglpF possessed significant tolerance of drought, salt, and certain metal ions. AgglpF was then characterized in the filamentous fungus of Neurospora crassa. Based on the N. crassa aquaporin gene (NcAQP) disruption mutant (the Deltaaqp mutant), a series of complementary strains carrying NcAQP and AgglpF and three asparagine-proline-alanine-gene (NPA)-deleted AgglpF fragments were created. As revealed by salt resistance analysis, the AgglpF complementary strain possessed the highest salt resistance among the tested strains. In addition, the intracellular glycerol content in the AgglpF complementary strain was markedly higher than that in the other strains. The AgGlpF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was subcellularly localized in the plasma membrane of onion epidermal cells, suggesting that AgglpF functions in plants. Indeed, when AgglpF was expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, transgenic lines survived under conditions of high osmotic stress and under conditions of drought stress in particular. Overall, our results revealed that AgGlpF as a water/glycerol transporter is required for survival of both fungi and plants under conditions of high osmotic stress and may have value in applications in genetic engineering for generating high salt and drought resistance.",?,Applied and environmental microbiology,China,2015 Oct
25268858,"Characterizing the roles of Cryphonectria parasitica RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-like genes in antiviral defense, viral recombination and transposon transcript accumulation.","An inducible RNA-silencing pathway, involving a single Dicer protein, DCL2, and a single Argonaute protein, AGL2, was recently shown to serve as an effective antiviral defense response in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica. Eukaryotic RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) are frequently involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene silencing and antiviral defense. We report here the identification and characterization of four RdRP genes (rdr1-4) in the C. parasitica genome. Sequence relationships with other eukaryotic RdRPs indicated that RDR1 and RDR2 were closely related to QDE-1, an RdRP involved in RNA silencing (""quelling"") in Neurospora crassa, whereas RDR3 was more closely related to the meiotic silencing gene SAD-1 in N. crassa. The RdRP domain of RDR4, related to N. crassa RRP-3 of unknown function, was truncated and showed evidence of alternative splicing. Similar to reports for dcl2 and agl2, the expression levels for rdr3 and rdr4 increased after hypovirus CHV-1/EP713 infection, while expression levels of rdr1 and rdr2 were unchanged. The virus-responsive induction patterns for rdr3 and rdr4 were altered in the Deltadcl2 and Deltaagl2 strains, suggesting some level of interaction between rdr3 and rdr4 and the dcl2/agl2 silencing pathway. Single rdr gene knockouts Deltardr1-4, double knockouts Deltardr1/2, Deltardr2/3, Deltardr1/3, and a triple knockout, Deltardr1/2/3, were generated and evaluated for effects on fungal phenotype, the antiviral defense response, viral RNA recombination activity and transposon expression. None of the single or multiple rdr knockout strains displayed any phenotypic differences from the parental strains with or without viral infection or any significant changes in viral RNA accumulation or recombination activity or transposon RNA accumulation, indicating no detectable contribution by the C. parasitica rdr genes to these processes.",?,PloS one,United States of America,2014
35286209,A dialogue-like cell communication mechanism is conserved in filamentous ascomycete fungi and mediates interspecies interactions.,"In many filamentous fungi, germinating spores cooperate by fusing into supracellular structures, which develop into the mycelial colony. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, this social behavior is mediated by an intriguing mode of communication, in which two fusing cells take turns in signal sending and receiving. Here we show that this dialogue-like cell communication mechanism is highly conserved in distantly related fungal species and mediates interspecies interactions. In mixed populations, cells of N. crassa and the phytopathogenic gray mold Botrytis cinerea coordinate their behavior over a spatial distance and establish physical contact. Subsequent cell-cell fusion is, however, restricted to germlings of the same species, indicating that species specificity of germling fusion has evolved not on the level of the signal/receptor but at subsequent levels of the fusion process. In B. cinerea, fusion and infectious growth are mutually exclusive cellular programs. Remarkably, the presence of N. crassa can reprogram this behavior and induce fusion of the gray mold on plant surfaces, potentially weakening its pathogenic potential. In a third fungal species, the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys flagrans, the conserved signaling mechanism mediates vegetative fusion within mycelial colonies but has also been repurposed for the formation of nematode-catching traps. In summary, this study identified the cell dialogue mechanism as a conserved complex trait and revealed that even distantly related fungi possess a common molecular language, which promotes cellular contact formation across species borders.","['cell fusion', 'cell signaling', 'fungi', 'interspecies interaction', 'pathogenicity']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Germany,2022 Mar 22
35709910,"The Zymoseptoria tritici white collar-1 gene, ZtWco-1, is required for development and virulence on wheat.","The fungus Zymoseptoria tritici causes Septoria Tritici Blotch (STB), which is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat in Europe. There are currently no fully durable methods of control against Z. tritici, so novel strategies are urgently required. One of the ways in which fungi are able to respond to their surrounding environment is through the use of photoreceptor proteins which detect light signals. Although previous evidence suggests that Z. tritici can detect light, no photoreceptor genes have been characterised in this pathogen. This study characterises ZtWco-1, a predicted photoreceptor gene in Z. tritici. The ZtWco-1 gene is a putative homolog to the blue light photoreceptor from Neurospora crassa, wc-1. Z. tritici mutants with deletions in ZtWco-1 have defects in hyphal branching, melanisation and virulence on wheat. In addition, we identify the putative circadian clock gene ZtFrq in Z. tritici. This study provides evidence for the genetic regulation of light detection in Z. tritici and it open avenues for future research into whether this pathogen has a circadian clock.","['Light', 'Wheat', 'White collar', 'Zymoseptoria tritici']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Republic of Ireland.

In this study, we investigated the potential of the Crabtree-negative, oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as an alternative host for ergothioneine production. We expressed the biosynthetic enzymes EGT1 from Neurospora crassa and EGT2 from Claviceps purpurea to obtain 158 mg.L(-1) of ergothioneine in small-scale cultivation, with an additional copy of each gene improving the titer to 205 mg.L(-1) . The effect of phosphate limitation on ergothioneine production was studied, and finally, a phosphate-limited fed-batch fermentation in 1 L bioreactors yielded 1.63 +/- 0.04 g.L(-1) ergothioneine in 220 h, corresponding to an overall volumetric productivity of 7.41 mg.L(-1) .h(-1) , showing that Y. lipolytica is a promising host for ergothioneine production.","['Yarrowia lipolytica', 'ergothioneine', 'metabolic engineering', 'nutraceutical', 'phosphate-limitation']",FEBS letters,Denmark,2022 May
29227022,The GATA-type IVb zinc-finger transcription factor SsNsd1 regulates asexual-sexual development and appressoria formation in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.,"The sclerotium, a multicellular structure composed of the compact aggregation of vegetative hyphae, is critical for the long-term survival and sexual reproduction of the plant-pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The development and carpogenic germination of sclerotia are regulated by integrating signals from both environmental and endogenous processes. Here, we report the regulatory functions of the S. sclerotiorum GATA-type IVb zinc-finger transcription factor SsNsd1 in these processes. SsNsd1 is orthologous to the Aspergillus nidulans NsdD (never in sexual development) and the Neurospora crassa SUB-1 (submerged protoperithecia-1) proteins. Ssnsd1 gene transcript accumulation remains relatively low, but variable, during vegetative mycelial growth and multicellular development. Ssnsd1 deletion mutants (Deltansd1-KOs) produce phialides and phialospores (spermatia) excessively in vegetative hyphae and promiscuously within the interior medulla of sclerotia. In contrast, phialospore development occurs only on the sclerotium surface in the wild-type. Loss of SsNsd1 function affects sclerotium structural integrity and disrupts ascogonia formation during conditioning for carpogenic germination. As a consequence, apothecium development is abolished. The Ssnsd1 deletion mutants are also defective in the transition from hyphae to compound appressorium formation, resulting in a loss of pathogenicity on unwounded hosts. In sum, our results demonstrate that SsNsd1 functions in a regulatory role similar to its ascomycete orthologues in regulating sexual and asexual development. Further, SsNsd1 appears to have evolved as a regulator of pre-penetration infectious development required for the successful infection of its many hosts.","['NsdD', 'appressorium', 'asexual development', 'sexual development', 'spermatia']",Molecular plant pathology,USA,2018 Jul
27109373,Molecular dissection of SO (SOFT) protein in stress-induced aggregation and cell-to-cell interactive functions in filamentous fungal multicellularity.,"Filamentous fungi grow by organizing multicellularity through hyphal compartmentalization and cell fusion. SO (SOFT) protein, which was originally identified in Neurospora crassa, plays distinct functional roles in cell-to-cell interactions, such as septal plugging and cell fusion. We previously reported that AoSO, an Aspergillus oryzae SO homologue, forms aggregates at the septal pore in response to stress, as well as upon hyphal wounding. However, the functional regions that mediate the multicellular functions of AoSO, which is a large protein composed of 1195 amino acids, have not been elucidated. Here, we divided AoSO protein into regions according to amino acid sequence conservation among other fungal SO homologues. By heterologous expression of full-length and truncated forms of AoSO in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the region responsible for the stress-induced aggregation of AoSO was identified to be between amino acids 556 and 1146. In A. oryzae, however, septal localization of AoSO aggregates required the 49 C-terminal amino acids. Thus, expression of only the C-terminal half of AoSO was sufficient for septal plugging and prevention of excessive cytoplasmic loss upon hyphal wounding. In contrast, the N-terminal half of AoSO, from amino acids 1 to 555, together with the C-terminal end, was revealed to be indispensable for cell fusion. Collectively, these findings suggest that the C-terminal half of AoSO, which mediates stress-induced aggregation, is required for both septal plugging and cell fusion, whereas the N-terminal half confers an additional functionality that is essential for cell fusion.","['Cell fusion', 'Filamentous fungi', 'Intercellular connectivity', 'Septum']",Fungal biology,Japan,2016 May
26691528,A novel Zn2 Cys6 transcription factor BcGaaR regulates D-galacturonic acid utilization in Botrytis cinerea.,"D-galacturonic acid (GalA) is the most abundant monosaccharide component of pectin. Previous transcriptome analysis in the plant pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea identified eight GalA-inducible genes involved in pectin decomposition, GalA transport and utilization. Co-expression of these genes indicates that a specific regulatory mechanism occurs in B. cinerea. In this study, promoter regions of these genes were analysed and eight conserved sequence motifs identified. The Bclga1 promoter, containing all these motifs, was functionally analysed and the motif designated GalA Responsive Element (GARE) was identified as the crucial cis-regulatory element in regulation of GalA utilization in B. cinerea. Yeast one-hybrid screening with the GARE motif led to identification of a novel Zn2 Cys6 transcription factor (TF), designated BcGaaR. Targeted knockout analysis revealed that BcGaaR is required for induction of GalA-inducible genes and growth of B. cinerea on GalA. A BcGaaR-GFP fusion protein was predominantly localized in nuclei in mycelium grown in GalA. Fluorescence in nuclei was much stronger in mycelium grown in GalA, as compared to fructose and glucose. This study provides the first report of a GalA-specific TF in filamentous fungi. Orthologs of BcGaaR are present in other ascomycete fungi that are able to utilize GalA, including Aspergillus spp., Trichoderma reesei and Neurospora crassa.",?,Molecular microbiology,The Netherlands,2016 Apr

This is based on the development of methods for artificial virus introduction and elimination, host genome manipulability, available host genome sequence with annotations, host mutant strains, and molecular tools. Molecular tools include sub-cellular distribution markers, gene expression reporters, and vectors with regulatable promoters that have been long available for unicellular organisms, cultured cells, individuals of animals and plants, and certain filamentous fungi.

24906411,"VibA, a homologue of a transcription factor for fungal heterokaryon incompatibility, is involved in antifungal compound production in the plant-symbiotic fungus Epichloe festucae.","Symbiotic association of epichloae endophytes (Epichloe/Neotyphodium species) with cool-season grasses of the subfamily Pooideae confers bioprotective benefits to the host plants against abiotic and biotic stresses. While the production of fungal bioprotective metabolites is a well-studied mechanism of host protection from insect herbivory, little is known about the antibiosis mechanism against grass pathogens by the mutualistic endophyte. In this study, an Epichloe festucae mutant defective in antimicrobial substance production was isolated by a mutagenesis approach. In an isolated mutant that had lost antifungal activity, the exogenous DNA fragment was integrated into the promoter region of the vibA gene, encoding a homologue of the transcription factor VIB-1. VIB-1 in Neurospora crassa is a regulator of genes essential in vegetative incompatibility and promotion of cell death. Here we show that deletion of the vibA gene severely affected the antifungal activity of the mutant against the test pathogen Drechslera erythrospila. Further analyses showed that overexpressing vibA enhanced the antifungal activity of the wild-type isolate against test pathogens. Transformants overexpressing vibA showed an inhibitory activity on test pathogens that the wild-type isolate could not. Moreover, overexpressing vibA in a nonantifungal E. festucae wild-type Fl1 isolate enabled the transformant to inhibit the mycelial and spore germination of D. erythrospila. These results demonstrate that enhanced expression of vibA is sufficient for a nonantifungal isolate to obtain antifungal activity, implicating the critical role of VibA in antifungal compound production by epichloae endophytes.",?,Eukaryotic cell,Japan,2015 Jan
24813188,"A large nonconserved region of the tethering protein Leashin is involved in regulating the position, movement, and function of Woronin bodies in Aspergillus oryzae.","The Woronin body is a Pezizomycotina-specific organelle that is typically tethered to the septum, but upon hyphal wounding, it plugs the septal pore to prevent excessive cytoplasmic loss. Leashin (LAH) is a large Woronin body tethering protein that contains highly conserved N- and C-terminal regions and a long ( approximately 2,500-amino-acid) nonconserved middle region. As the involvement of the nonconserved region in Woronin body function has not been investigated, here, we functionally characterized individual regions of the LAH protein of Aspergillus oryzae (AoLAH). In an Aolah disruptant, no Woronin bodies were tethered to the septum, and hyphae had a reduced ability to prevent excessive cytoplasmic loss upon hyphal wounding. Localization analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of AoLAH associated with Woronin bodies dependently on AoWSC, which is homologous to Neurospora crassa WSC (Woronin body sorting complex), and that the C-terminal region was localized to the septum. Elastic movement of Woronin bodies was observed when visualized with an AoLAH N-terminal-region-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion protein. An N- and C-terminal fusion construct lacking the nonconserved middle region of AoLAH was sufficient for the tethering of Woronin bodies to the septum. However, Woronin bodies were located closer to the septum and exhibited impaired elastic movement. Moreover, expression of middle-region-deleted AoLAH in the Aolah disruptant did not restore the ability to prevent excessive cytoplasmic loss. These findings indicate that the nonconserved middle region of AoLAH has functional importance for regulating the position, movement, and function of Woronin bodies.",?,Eukaryotic cell,Japan,2014 Jul
36294581,Sordaria macrospora Sterile Mutant pro34 Is Impaired in Respiratory Complex I Assembly.,"The formation of fruiting bodies is a highly regulated process that requires the coordinated formation of different cell types. By analyzing developmental mutants, many developmental factors have already been identified. Yet, a complete understanding of fruiting body formation is still lacking. In this study, we analyzed developmental mutant pro34 of the filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora. Genome sequencing revealed a deletion in the pro34 gene encoding a putative mitochondrial complex I assembly factor homologous to Neurospora crassa CIA84. We show that PRO34 is required for fast vegetative growth, fruiting body and ascospore formation. The pro34 transcript undergoes adenosine to inosine editing, a process correlated with sexual development in fruiting body-forming ascomycetes. Fluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis showed that PRO34 is a mitochondrial protein, and blue-native PAGE revealed that the pro34 mutant lacks mitochondrial complex I. Inhibitor experiments revealed that pro34 respires via complexes III and IV, but also shows induction of alternative oxidase, a shunt pathway to bypass complexes III and IV. We discuss the hypothesis that alternative oxidase is induced to prevent retrograde electron transport to complex I intermediates, thereby protecting from oxidative stress.","['RNA editing', 'alternative oxidase (AOX)', 'ascospore formation', 'cytochrome c oxidase (COX)', 'fruiting body formation', 'mitochondrial complex I assembly', 'mitochondrial respiration']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",Germany,2022 Sep 27
35736107,Dynamic Genome-Wide Transcription Profiling and Direct Target Genes of CmWC-1 Reveal Hierarchical Light Signal Transduction in Cordyceps militaris.,"Light is necessary for primordium differentiation and fruiting body development for most edible fungi; however, light perception and signal transduction have only been well studied in model fungi. In this study, a hierarchical network of transcriptional response to light in Cordyceps militaris, one of the edible fungi, has been described on a genome-wide scale using dynamic transcriptome analysis. It was shown that light regulated the transcript of 1722 genes, making up 18% of the whole genome of C. militaris. Analysis of light-responsive genes in C. militaris identified 4 categories: immediate-early, early, late, and continuous light-responsive genes, and the gene number increased distinctly with prolonged light exposure. Light-responsive genes with distinct functional categories showed specific time-dependent regulation. The target genes of CmWC-1, the most important photoreceptor, were revealed by ChIP-seq. A total of 270 significant peaks corresponding to 427 genes were identified to be directly regulated by CmWC-1, among which 143 genes respond to light. Based on 270 ChIP-seq peaks, the binding site for CmWC-1 was identified as AAATCAGACCAC/GTGGTCTGATTT, differing from the binding site by the homolog in Neurospora crassa. Elucidating the mechanisms of light perception and signal transduction will be helpful for further research on the fruiting body development in edible fungi.","['ChIP-seq', 'CmWC-1', 'Cordyceps militaris', 'light-responsive genes', 'metabolite biosynthetic gene', 'target genes', 'transcriptomics']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",China,2022 Jun 11
33675987,Visualizing three-dimensional fungal growth using light sheet fluorescence microscopy.,"The evaluation of morphology is fundamental to comprehend how fungi grow, develop, and interact with the environment. Although fungal growth has been extensively studied associated to two-dimensional geometries, lack of appropriate experimental tools has limited exploration of the complex three-dimensional (3D) structures exhibited by mycelia in more general contexts. In this paper, we report the construction of a light-sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM) capable of performing time-lapse visualization of 3D biological structures (4D microscopy), and the use of this instrument to follow the dynamics of fungal growth. LSFM uses scanning of selective plane illumination and digital reconstruction to provide 3D images of the specimen.

We successfully demonstrate use of both autofluorescence and specific tagging to image Trichoderma atroviride and Neurospora crassa strains growing in liquid media, over extended times (~12 h) and volumes (~400 x 1500 x 800 mum(3)) at single-hypha resolution. The excellent image contrast provided by LSFM enables us to visualize the dynamics of mycelial architecture, interactions among hyphae, and measure rates of 3D apical extension. Altogether, our work shows a powerful imaging tool to perform 3D morphological analysis of fungi, from hyphae to mycelium.","['3D microscopy', 'Hyphal growth', 'Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy', 'Mycelial architecture', 'Mycelial dynamics']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Mexico.

24129845,"The gene cutA of Fusarium fujikuroi, encoding a protein of the haloacid dehalogenase family, is involved in osmotic stress and glycerol metabolism.","Survival of micro-organisms in natural habitats depends on their ability to adapt to variations in osmotic conditions. We previously described the gene cut-1 of Neurospora crassa, encoding a protein of the haloacid dehalogenase family with an unknown function in the osmotic stress response. Here we report on the functional analysis of cutA, the orthologous gene in the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium fujikuroi. cutA mRNA levels increased transiently after exposure to 0.68 M NaCl and were reduced upon return to normal osmotic conditions; deletion of the gene resulted in a partial reduction in tolerance to osmotic stress. DeltacutA mutants contained much lower intracellular levels of glycerol than the wild-type, and did not exhibit the increase following hyper-osmotic shock expected from the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response. cutA is linked and divergently transcribed with the putative glycerol dehydrogenase gene gldB, which showed the same regulation by osmotic shock. The intergenic cutA/gldB regulatory region contains putative stress-response elements conserved in other fungi, and both genes shared other regulatory features, such as induction by heat shock and by illumination. Photoinduction was also observed in the HOG response gene hogA, and was lost in mutants of the white collar gene wcoA. Previous data on glycerol production in Aspergillus spp. and features of the predicted CutA protein lead us to propose that F. fujikuroi produces glycerol from dihydroxyacetone, and that CutA is the enzyme involved in the synthesis of this precursor by dephosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone-3P.",?,"Microbiology (Reading, England)",Spain,2014 Jan
23988676,Molecular tools for functional genomics in filamentous fungi: recent advances and new strategies.,"Advances in genetic transformation techniques have made important contributions to molecular genetics. Various molecular tools and strategies have been developed for functional genomic analysis of filamentous fungi since the first DNA transformation was successfully achieved in Neurospora crassa in 1973. Increasing amounts of genomic data regarding filamentous fungi are continuously reported and large-scale functional studies have become common in a wide range of fungal species. In this review, various molecular tools used in filamentous fungi are compared and discussed, including methods for genetic transformation (e.g., protoplast transformation, electroporation, and microinjection), the construction of random mutant libraries (e.g., restriction enzyme mediated integration, transposon arrayed gene knockout, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation), and the analysis of gene function (e.g., RNA interference and transcription activator-like effector nucleases). We also focused on practical strategies that could enhance the efficiency of genetic manipulation in filamentous fungi, such as choosing a proper screening system and marker genes, assembling target-cassettes or vectors effectively, and transforming into strains that are deficient in the nonhomologous end joining pathway.

Further cost savings could be gained by reducing enzyme loading and engineering host strain for ethanol production. In this study, we demonstrate efficient ethanol production by SSF without supplementation of beta-glucosidase using an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain expressing a cellodextrin transporter and an intracellular beta-glucosidase from Neurospora crassa. Ethanol production profiles by the engineered yeast without supplementation of beta-glucosidase and by a parental strain with supplementation of beta-glucosidase were examined under various fermentation conditions. When initial cell mass concentrations were low, the traditional SSF with supplementation of beta-glucosidase showed better ethanol production than SSF with the engineered strain without supplementing beta-glucosidase. However, the engineered strain without supplementation of beta-glucosidase showed almost the same or even better ethanol productivity than the parental strain with supplementation of beta-glucosidase when initial cell mass concentrations were elevated. Our results suggest that efficient ethanol production by SSF could be achieved by engineered yeast capable of fermenting cellobiose without addition of extracellular beta-glucosidase, leading to economic production of cellulosic ethanol.","['Cellodextrin transporter', 'Cellulosic ethanol', 'Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Intracellular beta-glucosidase', 'Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation']",Journal of biotechnology,USA,2013 Sep 10

Microbial fermentation is a promising method for ERG production. In this study, the bifunctional enzyme methyltransferase-sulfoxide synthase NcEgt1 from Neurospora crassa was truncated to obtain sulfoxide synthase (T)NcEgt1, which showed a higher expression level in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Then, the genes egtD encoding methyltransferase EgtD and egtE encoding C-S lyase EgtE from Mycobacterium smegmatis were cloned with (T)ncEgt1 into E. coli BL21(DE3) to produce 70 mg/L ERG. To improve ERG production, (T)NcEgt1 and EgtD were modified, and the resulting mutants were screened with an established high-throughput method which could directly analyze the ERG content in culture broths. After several rounds of mutation and screening, the optimal mutant MD4 was obtained and produced 290 mg/L ERG. Furthermore, a fed-batch culture was conducted in a 5 L bioreactor. After optimizing the fermentation process, the ERG yield reached 5.4 g/L after 94 h of cultivation supplemented with amino acids and glycerol, which is the highest ERG yield reported to date.

35722316,Gene Regulatory Network Inference and Gene Module Regulating Virulence in Fusarium oxysporum.,"In this work, we inferred the gene regulatory network (GRN) of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum by using the regulatory networks of Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4, Neurospora crassa OR74A, Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c, and Fusarium graminearum PH-1 as templates for sequence comparisons. Topological properties to infer the role of transcription factors (TFs) and to identify functional modules were calculated in the GRN. From these analyzes, five TFs were identified as hubs, including FOXG_04688 and FOXG_05432, which regulate 2,404 and 1,864 target genes, respectively. In addition, 16 communities were identified in the GRN, where the largest contains 1,923 genes and the smallest contains 227 genes. Finally, the genes associated with virulence were extracted from the GRN and exhaustively analyzed, and we identified a giant module with ten TFs and 273 target genes, where the most highly connected node corresponds to the transcription factor FOXG_05265, homologous to the putative bZip transcription factor CPTF1 of Claviceps purpurea, which is involved in ergotism disease that affects cereal crops and grasses.

Here, we not only independently control the self-assembly of two cell types into multicellular architectures with blue and red light, but also achieve their self-sorting into distinct assemblies. This required developing two cell types that form selective and homophilic cell-cell interactions either under blue or red light using photoswitchable proteins as artificial adhesion molecules. The interactions were individually triggerable with different colors of light, reversible in the dark, and provide noninvasive and temporal control over the cell-cell adhesions. In mixtures of the two cells, each cell type self-assembled independently upon orthogonal photoactivation, and cells sorted out into separate assemblies based on specific self-recognition. These self-sorted multicellular architectures provide us with a powerful tool for producing tissue-like structures from multiple cell types and investigate principles that govern them.","['cell-cell adhesions', 'multicellularity', 'optogenetics', 'photoswitchable', 'self-sorting']",ACS synthetic biology,Germany,2020 Aug 21
30317479,Reconstitution of Molybdoenzymes with Bis-Molybdopterin Guanine Dinucleotide Cofactors.,"Molybdoenzymes are ubiquitous and play important roles in all kingdoms of life. The cofactors of these enzymes comprise the metal, molybdenum (Mo), which is bound to a special organic ligand system called molybdopterin (MPT). Additional small ligands are present at the Mo atom, including water, hydroxide, oxo-, sulfido-, or selenido-functionalities, and in some enzymes, amino acid ligand, such as serine, aspartate, cysteine, or selenocysteine that coordinate the cofactor to the peptide chain of the enzyme. The so-called molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is deeply buried within the protein at the end of a narrow funnel, giving access only to the substrate. In 1974, an assay was developed by Nason and coworkers using the pleiotropic Neurospora crassa mutant, nit-1, for the reconstitution of molybdoenzyme activities from crude extracts. These studies have led to the understanding that Moco is the common element in all molybdoenzymes from different organisms. The assay has been further developed since then by using specific molybdenum enzymes as the source of Moco for the reconstitution of diverse purified apo-molybdoenzymes. Alternatively, the molybdenum cofactor can be synthesized in vitro from stable intermediates and subsequently inserted into apo-molybdoenzymes with the assistance of specific Moco-binding chaperones. A general working protocol is described here for the insertion of the bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor (bis-MGD) into its target molybdoenzyme using the example of Escherichia coli trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase.","['Bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor (bis-MGD)', 'Molybdenum cofactor (Moco)', 'Molybdoenzymes', 'Molybdopterin (MPT)', 'Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase']","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Germany,2019
26092802,Fluorescent markers for the Spitzenkorper and exocytosis in Zymoseptoria tritici.,"Fungal hyphae are highly polarized cells that invade their substrate by tip growth. In plant pathogenic fungi, hyphal growth is essential for host invasion. This makes polarity factors and secretion regulators potential new targets for novel fungicides. Polarization requires delivery of secretory vesicles to the apical Spitzenkorper, followed by polarized exocytosis at the expanding cell tip. Here, we introduce fluorescent markers to visualize the apical Spitzenkorper and the apical site of exocytosis in hyphae of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We fused green fluorescent protein to the small GTPase ZtSec4, the myosin light chain ZtMlc1 and the small GTPase ZtRab11 and co-localize the fusion proteins with the dye FM4-64 in the hyphal apex, suggesting that the markers label the hyphal Spitzenkorper in Z. tritici. In addition, we localize GFP-fusions to the exocyst protein ZtExo70, the polarisome protein ZtSpa2. Consistent with results in the ascomycete Neurospora crassa, these markers did localize near the plasma membrane at the hyphal tip and only partially co-localize with FM4-64. Thus, these fluorescent markers are useful molecular tools that allow phenotypic analysis of mutants in Z. tritici. These tools will help develop new avenues of research in our quest to control STB infection in wheat.","['Exocytosis', 'Hyphal tip', 'Mycosphaerella graminicola', 'Pathogenic fungi', 'Secretion', 'Septoria tritici blotch']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,UK,2015 Jun
35007751,CelloSelect - A synthetic cellobiose metabolic pathway for selection of stable transgenic CHO cell lines.,"Current protocols for generating stable transgenic cell lines mostly rely on antibiotic selection or the use of specialized cell lines lacking an essential part of their metabolic machinery, but these approaches require working with either toxic chemicals or knockout cell lines, which can reduce productivity. Since most mammalian cells cannot utilize cellobiose, a disaccharide consisting of two beta-1,4-linked glucose molecules, we designed an antibiotic-free selection system, CelloSelect, which consists of a selection cassette encoding Neurospora crassa cellodextrin transporter CDT1 and beta-glucosidase GH1-1. When cultivated in glucose-free culture medium containing cellobiose, CelloSelect-transfected cells proliferate by metabolizing cellobiose as a primary energy source, and are protected from glucose starvation. We show that the combination of CelloSelect with a PiggyBac transposase-based integration strategy provides a platform for the swift and efficient generation of stable transgenic cell lines. Growth rate analysis of metabolically engineered cells in cellobiose medium confirmed the expansion of cells stably expressing high levels of a cargo fluorescent marker protein. We further validated this strategy by applying the CelloSelect system for stable integration of sequences encoding two biopharmaceutical proteins, erythropoietin and the monoclonal antibody rituximab, and confirmed that the proteins are efficiently produced in either cellobiose- or glucose-containing medium in suspension-adapted CHO cells cultured in chemically defined media. We believe coupling heterologous metabolic pathways additively to the endogenous metabolism of mammalian cells has the potential to complement or to replace current cell-line selection systems.",['Synthetic biology'],Metabolic engineering,Switzerland,2022 Mar
32117134,"Characterization, Expression Profiling, and Functional Analysis of PtDef, a Defensin-Encoding Gene From Populus trichocarpa.","PtDef cloned from Populus trichocarpa contained eight cysteine domains specific to defensins. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that PtDef was expressed in all tissues tested, with lower expression in leaves and higher expression in petioles, stems, and roots. Purified fused PtDef inhibited Aspergillus niger, Alternaria Nees, Mucor corymbifer, Marssonina populi, Rhizopus sp., and Neurospora crassa. PtDef also inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli by triggering autolysis. PtDef overexpression in Nanlin895 poplar (Populus x euramericana cv. Nanlin895) enhanced the level of resistance to Septotinia populiperda. qRT-PCR analysis also showed that the expression of 13 genes related to salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signal transduction differed between transgenic and wild-type (WT) poplars before and after inoculation, and that PR1-1 (12-72 h), NPR1-2, TGA1, and MYC2-1 expression was higher in transgenic poplars than in WT. During the hypersensitivity response (HR), large amounts of H(2)O(2) were produced by the poplar lines, particularly 12-24 h after inoculation; the rate and magnitude of the H(2)O(2) concentration increase were greater in transgenic lines than in WT. Overall, our findings suggest that PtDef, a defensin-encoding gene of P. trichocarpa, could be used for genetic engineering of woody plants for enhanced disease resistance.","['JA', 'Nanlin895 poplar', 'Populus trichocarpa', 'PtDef', 'SA', 'defensin']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2020
31752060,RNAi-Mediated Gene Silencing of Trcot1 Induces a Hyperbranching Phenotype in Trichoderma reesei.,"Trichoderma reesei is the major filamentous fungus used to produce cellulase and there is huge interest in promoting its ability to produce higher titers of cellulase. Among the many factors affecting cellulase production in T. reesei, the mycelial phenotype is important but seldom studied. Herein, a close homolog of the Neurospora crassa COT1 kinase was discovered in T. reesei and designated TrCOT1, which is of 83.3% amino acid sequence identity. Functional disruption of Trcot1 in T. reesei by RNAi-mediated gene silencing resulted in retarded sporulation on potato dextrose agar and dwarfed colonies on minimal medium agar plates containing glucose, xylan, lactose, xylose, or glycerol as the sole carbon source. The representative mutant strain, SUS2/Trcot1i, also displayed reduced mycelia accumulation but hyperbranching in the MM glucose liquid medium, with hyphal growth unit length values decreased to 73.0 microm/tip compared to 239.8 microm/tip for the parent strain SUS2. The hyperbranching phenotype led to slightly but significantly increased cellulase secretion from 24 to 72 h in a batch culture. However, the cellulase production per unit of mycelial biomass was much more profoundly improved from 24 to 96 h.","['RNAi', 'Trcot1', 'Trichoderma reesei', 'biofuel', 'cellulase', 'hyperbranching']",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,P.R.

31692262,Hansenula polymorpha Pex37 is a peroxisomal membrane protein required for organelle fission and segregation.,"Here, we describe a novel peroxin, Pex37, in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. H. polymorpha Pex37 is a peroxisomal membrane protein, which belongs to a protein family that includes, among others, the Neurospora crassa Woronin body protein Wsc, the human peroxisomal membrane protein PXMP2, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial inner membrane protein Sym1, and its mammalian homologue MPV17. We show that deletion of H. polymorpha PEX37 does not appear to have a significant effect on peroxisome biogenesis or proliferation in cells grown at peroxisome-inducing growth conditions (methanol). However, the absence of Pex37 results in a reduction in peroxisome numbers and a defect in peroxisome segregation in cells grown at peroxisome-repressing conditions (glucose). Conversely, overproduction of Pex37 in glucose-grown cells results in an increase in peroxisome numbers in conjunction with a decrease in their size. The increase in numbers in PEX37-overexpressing cells depends on the dynamin-related protein Dnm1. Together our data suggest that Pex37 is involved in peroxisome fission in glucose-grown cells. Introduction of human PXMP2 in H. polymorpha pex37 cells partially restored the peroxisomal phenotype, indicating that PXMP2 represents a functional homologue of Pex37. H.polymorpha pex37 cells did not show aberrant growth on any of the tested carbon and nitrogen sources that are metabolized by peroxisomal enzymes, suggesting that Pex37 may not fulfill an essential function in transport of these substrates or compounds required for their metabolism across the peroxisomal membrane.","['PXMP2', 'Pex37', 'Sym1', 'Wsc', 'peroxisome', 'yeast']",The FEBS journal,the Netherlands,2020 May
31689405,Design Principles of Branching Morphogenesis in Filamentous Organisms.,"The radiation of life on Earth was accompanied by the diversification of multicellular body plans in the eukaryotic kingdoms Animalia, Plantae, Fungi and Chromista. Branching forms are ubiquitous in nature and evolved repeatedly in the above lineages. The developmental and genetic basis of branch formation is well studied in the three-dimensional shoot and root systems of land plants, and in animal organs such as the lung, kidney, mammary gland, vasculature, etc. Notably, recent thought-provoking studies combining experimental analysis and computational modeling of branching patterns in whole animal organs have identified global patterning rules and proposed unifying principles of branching morphogenesis. Filamentous branching forms represent one of the simplest expressions of the multicellular body plan and constitute a key step in the evolution of morphological complexity. Similarities between simple and complex branching forms distantly related in evolution are compelling, raising the question whether shared mechanisms underlie their development. Here, we focus on filamentous branching organisms that represent major study models from three distinct eukaryotic kingdoms, including the moss Physcomitrella patens (Plantae), the brown alga Ectocarpus sp. (Chromista), and the ascomycetes Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans (Fungi), and bring to light developmental regulatory mechanisms and design principles common to these lineages. Throughout the review we explore how the regulatory mechanisms of branching morphogenesis identified in other models, and in particular animal organs, may inform our thinking on filamentous systems and thereby advance our understanding of the diverse strategies deployed across the eukaryotic tree of life to evolve similar forms.",?,Current biology : CB,France.

25942565,Improvement of Omega-3 Docosahexaenoic Acid Production by Marine Dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii Using Rapeseed Meal Hydrolysate and Waste Molasses as Feedstock.,"Rapeseed meal and waste molasses are two important agro-industrial by-products which are produced in large quantities. In this study, solid state fermentation and fungal autolysis were performed to produce rapeseed meal hydrolysate (RMH) using fungal strains of Aspergillus oryzae, Penicillium oxalicum and Neurospora crassa. The hydrolysate was used as fermentation feedstock for heterotrophic growth of microalga Crypthecodinium cohnii that produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The addition of waste molasses as a supplementary carbon source greatly increased the biomass and DHA yield. In the batch fermentations using media composed of diluted RMH (7%) and 1-9% waste molasses, the highest biomass concentration and DHA yield reached 3.43 g/L and 8.72 mg/L, respectively. The algal biomass produced from RMH and molasses medium also had a high percentage of DHA (22-34%) in total fatty acids similar to that of commercial algal biomass. RMH was shown to be rich in nitrogen supply comparable to the commercial nitrogen feedstock like yeast extract. Using RMH as sole nitrogen source, waste molasses excelled other carbon sources and produced the highest concentration of biomass. This study suggests that DHA production of the marine dinoflagellate C. cohnii could be greatly improved by concomitantly using the cheap by-products rapeseed meal hydrolysate and molasses as alternative feedstock.",?,PloS one,P.R.

24532063,Role of the Alternaria alternata blue-light receptor LreA (white-collar 1) in spore formation and secondary metabolism.,"Alternaria alternata is a filamentous fungus that causes considerable loss of crops of economically important feed and food worldwide. It produces more than 60 different secondary metabolites, among which alternariol (AOH) and altertoxin (ATX) are the most important mycotoxins. We found that mycotoxin production and spore formation are regulated by light in opposite ways. Whereas spore formation was largely decreased under light conditions, the production of AOH was stimulated 2- to 3-fold. ATX production was even strictly dependent on light. All light effects observed could be triggered by blue light, whereas red light had only a minor effect. Inhibition of spore formation by light was reversible after 1 day of incubation in the dark. We identified orthologues of genes encoding the Neurospora crassa blue-light-perceiving white-collar proteins, a cryptochrome, a phytochrome, and an opsin-related protein in the genome of A. alternata. Deletion of the white-collar 1 (WC-1) gene (lreA) resulted in derepression of spore formation in dark and in light. ATX formation was strongly induced in the dark in the lreA mutant, suggesting a repressing function of LreA, which appears to be released in the wild type after blue-light exposure. In addition, light induction of AOH formation was partially dependent on LreA, suggesting also an activating function. A. alternata DeltalreA was still able to partially respond to blue light, indicating the action of another blue-light receptor system.",?,Applied and environmental microbiology,Germany,2014 Apr
23411871,Effect of heterologous xylose transporter expression in Candida tropicalis on xylitol production rate.,"Xylose utilization is inhibited by glucose uptake in xylose-assimilating yeasts, including Candida tropicalis, resulting in limitation of xylose uptake during the fermentation of glucose/xylose mixtures. In this study, a heterologous xylose transporter gene (At5g17010) from Arabidopsis thaliana was selected because of its high affinity for xylose and was codon-optimized for functional expression in C. tropicalis. The codon-optimized gene was placed under the control of the GAPDH promoter and was integrated into the genome of C. tropicalis strain LXU1 which is xyl2-disrupted and NXRG (codon-optimized Neurospora crassa xylose reductase) introduced. The xylose uptake rate was increased by 37-73 % in the transporter expression-enhanced strains depending on the glucose/xylose mixture ratio. The recombinant strain LXT2 in 500-mL flask culture using glucose/xylose mixtures showed a xylose uptake rate that was 29 % higher and a xylitol volumetric productivity (1.14 g/L/h) that was 25 % higher than the corresponding rates for control strain LXU1.

35729556,PHB production from cellobiose with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Replacement of petrochemical-based materials with microbially produced biodegradable alternatives calls for industrially attractive fermentation processes. Lignocellulosic materials offer non-edible alternatives for cultivated sugars, but require often use of expensive sugar releasing enzymes, such as beta-glucosidases. These cellulose treatment costs could be reduced if microbial production hosts could use short cellodextrins such as cellobiose directly as their substrates. In this study, we demonstrate production of poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using cellobiose as a sole carbon source. Yeast strains expressing PHB pathway genes from Cupriavidus necator and cellodextrin transporter gene CDT-1 from Neurospora crassa were complemented either with beta-glucosidase gene GH1-1 from N. crassa or with cellobiose phosphorylase gene cbp from Ruminococcus flavefaciens. These cellobiose utilization routes either with Gh1-1 or Cbp enzymes differ in energetics and dynamics. However, both routes enabled higher PHB production per consumed sugar and higher PHB accumulation % of cell dry weight (CDW) than use of glucose as a carbon source. As expected, the strains with Gh1-1 consumed cellobiose faster than the strains with Cbp, both in flask and bioreactor batch cultures. In shake flasks, higher final PHB accumulation % of CDW was reached with Cbp route (10.0 +/- 0.3%) than with Gh1-1 route (8.1 +/- 0.2%). However, a higher PHB accumulation was achieved in better aerated and pH-controlled bioreactors, in comparison to shake flasks, and the relative performance of strains switched. In bioreactors, notable PHB accumulation levels per CDW of 13.4 +/- 0.9% and 18.5 +/- 3.9% were achieved with Cbp and Gh1-1 routes, respectively. The average molecular weights of accumulated PHB were similar using both routes; approximately 500 kDa and 450 kDa for strains expressing either cbp or GH1-1 genes, respectively. The formation of PHB with high molecular weights, combined with efficient cellobiose conversion, demonstrates a highly potential solution for improving attractiveness of sustainable polymer production using microbial cells.","['Cellobiose', 'Cellobiose phosphorylase', 'Polyhydroxybutyrate', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'beta-glucosidase']",Microbial cell factories,Finland. anna.ylinen@vtt.fi,2022 Jun 21
34119728,Sustainable removal of Ni(II) from waste water by freshly isolated fungal strains.,"The release of untreated wastewater containing biotoxic substances in the form of heavy metals is one of the most crucial environmental and health challenges faced by our community. The recent advances in microbes derived removal has propelled bioremediation as a better and effective alternative to conventional techniques. Present study investigates the detoxification mechanisms evolved by the nickel (Ni(II)) resistant fungal strains, isolated from the industrial drain sites. The molecular detailing of the isolated fungal isolates confirms their identity as Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus flavus. Laboratory-scale experiments have established influence of different ranges of dose, pH, time, and metal concentration on the removal and uptake trends. Further, the variations in the carbon and nitrogen sources and agitation conditions has revealed the best substratum for achieving optimum results for the industrial exploitation of these microbes. SEM micrographs and FTIR spectra elucidates the superficial alterations on the mycelium of the fungal isolates and the involvement of active functional groups in the bioremediation of Ni(II) respectively. Biosorption of Ni(II) on living biomass has followed the Langmuir adsorption model.

33516198,Impacts of fludioxonil resistance on global gene expression in the necrotrophic fungal plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.,"BACKGROUND: The fungicide fludioxonil over-stimulates the fungal response to osmotic stress, leading to over-accumulation of glycerol and hyphal swelling and bursting. Fludioxonil-resistant fungal strains that are null-mutants for osmotic stress response genes are easily generated through continual sub-culturing on sub-lethal fungicide doses. Using this approach combined with RNA sequencing, we aimed to characterise the effects of mutations in osmotic stress response genes on the transcriptional profile of the important agricultural pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum under standard laboratory conditions. Our objective was to understand the impact of disruption of the osmotic stress response on the global transcriptional regulatory network in an important agricultural pathogen. RESULTS: We generated two fludioxonil-resistant S. sclerotiorum strains, which exhibited growth defects and hypersensitivity to osmotic stressors. Both had missense mutations in the homologue of the Neurospora crassa osmosensing two component histidine kinase gene OS1, and one had a disruptive in-frame deletion in a non-associated gene. RNA sequencing showed that both strains together differentially expressed 269 genes relative to the parent during growth in liquid broth. Of these, 185 (69%) were differentially expressed in both strains in the same direction, indicating similar effects of the different point mutations in OS1 on the transcriptome. Among these genes were numerous transmembrane transporters and secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is an initial investigation into the kinds of processes regulated through the osmotic stress pathway in S. sclerotiorum. It highlights a possible link between secondary metabolism and osmotic stress signalling, which could be followed up in future studies.","['Brassica napus', 'Fludioxonil', 'Fungicide resistance', 'Histidine kinase', 'Sclerotinia sclerotiorum', 'os1 gene']",BMC genomics,Australia,2021 Jan 30
29160602,Mitochondrial ribosome bL34 mutants present diminished translation of cytochrome c oxidase subunits.,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitoribosomes are specialized in the translation of a few number of highly hydrophobic membrane proteins, components of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Mitochondrial characteristics, such as the membrane system and its redox state driven mitoribosomes evolution through great diversion from their bacterial and cytosolic counterparts. Therefore, mitoribosome presents a considerable number of mitochondrial-specific proteins, as well as new protein extensions. In this work we characterize temperature sensitive mutants of the subunit bL34 present in the 54S large subunit. Although bL34 has bacterial homologs, in yeast it has a long 65 aminoacids mitochondrial N-terminal addressing sequence, here we demonstrate that it can be replaced by the mitochondrial addressing sequence of Neurospora crassa ATP9 gene. The bL34 temperature sensitive mutants present lowered translation of mitochondrial COX1 and COX3, which resulted in reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity and respiratory growth deficiency. The sedimentation properties of bL34 in sucrose gradients suggest that similarly to its bacterial homolog, bL34 is also a later participant in the process of mitoribosome biogenesis.","['cytochrome c oxidase', 'mitoribosome', 'mtDNA', 'respiratory chain', 'translation', 'yeast']",Cell biology international,Brazil,2018 Jun
27825301,Analysis of the association between codon optimality and mRNA stability in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.,"BACKGROUND: Recent experiments have shown that codon optimality is a major determinant of mRNA stability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and that this phenomenon may be conserved in Escherichia coli and some metazoans, although work in Neurospora crassa is not consistent with this model. RESULTS: We examined the association between codon optimality and mRNA stability in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our analysis revealed the following points. First, we observe a genome-wide association between codon optimality and mRNA stability also in S. pombe, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the phenomenon. Second, in both S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, mRNA synthesis rates are also correlated at the genome-wide analysis with codon optimality, suggesting that the long-appreciated association between codon optimality and mRNA abundance is due to regulation of both mRNA synthesis and degradation. However, when we examined correlation of codon optimality and either mRNA half-lives or synthesis rates controlling for mRNA abundance, codon optimality was still positively correlated with mRNA half-lives in S. cerevisiae, but the association was no longer significant for mRNA half-lives in S. pombe or for synthesis rates in either organism. This illustrates how only the pairwise analysis of multiple correlating variables may limit these types of analyses. Finally, in S. pombe, codon optimality is associated with known DNA/RNA sequence motifs that are associated with mRNA production/stability, suggesting these two features have been under similar selective pressures for optimal gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the emerging body of studies, this study suggests that the association between codon optimality and mRNA stability may be a broadly conserved phenomenon. It also suggests that the association can be explained at least in part by independent adaptations of codon optimality and other transcript features for elevated expression during evolution.","['Codon optimality', 'Evolutionary conservation', 'mRNA stability']",BMC genomics,USA. yuriko.harigaya@colorado.edu,2016 Nov 8
27213015,Salt-responsive lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases from the mangrove fungus Pestalotiopsis sp.

They are known to strongly improve the saccharification process and boost soluble sugar yields from lignocellulosic biomass, which is a key step in the efficient production of sustainable economic biofuels. To date, most LPMOs have been characterized from terrestrial fungi, but novel fungal LPMOs isolated from more extreme environments such as an estuary mangrove ecosystem could offer enzymes with unique properties in terms of salt tolerance and higher stability under harsh condition. RESULTS: Two LPMOs secreted by the mangrove-associated fungus Pestalotiopsis sp. NCi6 (PsLPMOA and PsLPMOB) were expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and produced in a bioreactor with >85 mg L(-1) for PsLPMOA and >260 mg L(-1) for PsLPMOB. Structure-guided homology modeling of the PsLPMOs showed a high abundance of negative surface charges, enabling enhanced protein stability and activity in the presence of sea salt. Both PsLPMOs were activated by a cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) from Neurospora crassa, with an apparent optimum of interaction at pH 5.5. Investigation into their regioselective mode of action revealed that PsLPMOA released C1- and C4-oxidized cello-oligosaccharide products, while PsLPMOB released only C4-oxidized products. PsLPMOA was found to cleave polymeric cellulose in the presence of up to 6 % sea salt, which emphasizes the use of sea water in the industrial saccharification process with improved ecological footprints. CONCLUSIONS: Two new LPMOs from the mangrove fungus Pestalotiopsis sp. NCi6 were found to be fully reactive against cellulose. The combined hydrolytic activities of these salt-responsive LPMOs could therefore facilitate the saccharification process using sea water as a reaction medium for large-scale biorefineries.","['AA9', 'Biorefinery', 'Cellobiose dehydrogenase', 'Cellulose', 'LPMO']",Biotechnology for biofuels,France,2016

In filamentous fungi, putative Ric8 orthologs have so far been identified in Magnaporthe oryzae, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Here, we report the functional investigation of a potential RIC8 ortholog (FgRIC8) in the wheat head blight pathogen Fusarium graminearum. Targeted gene deletion mutants of FgRIC8 exhibited a significant reduction in vegetative growth, conidiation, pigment production as well as deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis. Pathogenicity assays using a point-inoculated spikelet approach showed that the mutants were severely impaired in virulence on flowering wheat heads. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that genes encoding F. graminearum Galpha (FgGpa1 and FgGpa3), Gbeta (FgGpb1) and Ggamma (FgGpg1) subunits were significantly down-regulated in Fgric8 mutants. Moreover, we showed that FgRic8 physically interacts with both FgGpa1 and FgGpa3, but not FgGpa2, in yeast two-hybrid assays. The intracellular cAMP levels in Fgric8 mutants were significantly decreased compared to the isogenic wild-type strain. Taken together, our results indicate that FgRic8 plays critical roles in fungal development, secondary metabolism and virulence in F. graminearum and may act as a regulator of G protein alpha subunits.","['DON production', 'FgRIC8', 'Fusarium graminearum', 'G proteins', 'Virulence', 'cAMP signaling']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,China,2015 Oct
24519319,Directed evolution of a cellodextrin transporter for improved biofuel production under anaerobic conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Introduction of a cellobiose utilization pathway consisting of a cellodextrin transporter and a beta-glucosidase into Saccharomyces cerevisiae enables co-fermentation of cellobiose and xylose. Cellodextrin transporter 1 (CDT1) from Neurospora crassa has been established as an effective transporter for the engineered cellobiose utilization pathways. However, cellodextrin transporter 2 (CDT2) from the same species is a facilitator and has the potential to be more efficient than CDT1 under anaerobic conditions due to its energetic benefits. Currently, CDT2 has a very low activity and is considered rate-limiting in cellobiose fermentation. Here, we report the directed evolution of CDT2 with an increased cellobiose uptake activity, which results in improved cellobiose fermentation under anaerobic conditions. After three rounds of directed evolution, the cellobiose uptake activity of CDT2 was increased by 2.2-fold, which resulted from both increased specific activity and transporter expression level. Using high cell density fermentation under anaerobic conditions, the evolved mutant conferred 4.0- and 4.4-fold increase in the cellobiose consumption rate and ethanol productivity, respectively. In addition, although the cellobiose uptake activity was still lower than that of CDT1, the engineered CDT2 showed significantly improved cellobiose consumption and ethanol production under anaerobic conditions, representing the energetic benefits of a sugar facilitator for anaerobic cellobiose fermentation. This study demonstrated that anaerobic biofuel production could be significantly improved via directed evolution of a sugar transporter protein in yeast.","['anaerobic fermentation', 'cellobiose utilization', 'cellodextrin transporter', 'cellulosic biofuel', 'directed evolution']",Biotechnology and bioengineering,61801,2014 Aug
24380733,Distribution and evolution of het gene homologs in the basidiomycota.,"In filamentous fungi a system known as somatic incompatibility (SI) governs self/non-self recognition. SI is controlled by a regulatory signaling network involving proteins encoded at the het (heterokaryon incompatible) loci. Despite the wide occurrence of SI, the molecular identity and structure of only a small number of het genes and their products have been characterized in the model fungi Neurospora crassa and Podospora anserina. Our aim was to identify and study the distribution and evolution of putative het gene homologs in the Basidiomycota. For this purpose we used the information available for the model fungi to identify homologs of het genes in other fungi, especially the Basidiomycota. Putative het-c, het-c2 and un-24 homologs, as well as sequences containing the NACHT, HET or WD40 domains present in the het-e, het-r, het-6 and het-d genes were identified in certain members of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The widespread phylogenetic distribution of certain het genes may reflect the fact that the encoded proteins are involved in fundamental cellular processes other than SI. Although homologs of het-S were previously known only from the Sordariomycetes (Ascomycota), we also identified a putative homolog of this gene in Gymnopus luxurians (Basidiomycota, class Agaricomycetes). Furthermore, with the exception of un-24, all of the putative het genes identified occurred mostly in a multi-copy fashion, some with lineage and species-specific expansions. Overall our results indicated that gene duplication followed by gene loss and/or gene family expansion, as well as multiple events of domain fusion and shuffling played an important role in the evolution of het gene homologs of Basidiomycota and other filamentous fungi.","['Adaptive evolution', 'Domain shuffling and fusion', 'Gene family evolution', 'Het-S prion', 'Self/non-self recognition', 'Somatic incompatibility']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Sweden.

35628742,Interactions between Core Elements of the Botrytis cinerea Circadian Clock Are Modulated by Light and Different Protein Domains.,"Botrytis cinerea possesses a complex light-sensing system composed of eleven photoreceptors. In B. cinerea, bcwcl1 encodes for the BcWCL1 protein, the orthologue of the blue-light photoreceptor WC-1 from Neurospora crassa. The functional partner of BcWCL1 is the BcWCL2 protein, both interacting in the nucleus and forming the B. cinerea white collar complex (BcWCC). This complex is required for photomorphogenesis and circadian regulation. However, no molecular evidence shows a light-dependent interaction between the BcWCC components or light-sensing capabilities in BcWCL1. In this work, by employing a yeast two-hybrid system that allows for the in vivo analysis of protein-protein interactions, we confirm that BcWCL1 and BcWCL2 interact in the absence of light as well as upon blue-light stimulation, primarily through their PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domains. Deletion of the PAS domains present in BcWCL1 (BcWCL1(PASâˆ†)) or BcWCL2 (BcWCL2(PASâˆ†)) severely impairs the interaction between these proteins. Interestingly, the BcWCL1(PASâˆ†) protein shows a blue-light response and interacts with BcWCL2 or BcWCL2(PASâˆ†) upon light stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that BcWCL1 and BcWCL1(PASâˆ†) respond to blue light by introducing a point mutation in the photoactive cysteine, confirming that both proteins are capable of light sensing. Altogether, the results revealed the complexity of protein-protein interactions occurring between the core elements of the B. cinerea circadian clock.","['Botrytis cinerea', 'PAS and LOV domains', 'optogenetics', 'photoreceptors', 'yeast']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",Chile,2022 May 6
33574802,Impact of the White Collar Photoreceptor WcoA on the Fusarium fujikuroi Transcriptome.,"The proteins of the White Collar 1 family (WC) constitute a major class of flavin photoreceptors, widely distributed in fungi, that work in cooperation with a WC 2 protein forming a regulatory complex. The WC complex was investigated in great detail in Neurospora crassa, a model fungus in photobiology studies, where it controls all its major photoresponses. The fungus Fusarium fujikuroi, a model system in the production of secondary metabolites, contains a single WC-1 gene called wcoA. The best-known light response in this fungus is the photoinduction of the synthesis of carotenoids, terpenoid pigments with antioxidant properties. Loss of WcoA in F. fujikuroi results in a drastic reduction in the mRNA levels of the carotenoid genes, and a diversity of morphological and metabolic changes, including alterations in the synthesis of several secondary metabolites, suggesting a complex regulatory role. To investigate the function of WcoA, the transcriptome of F. fujikuroi was analyzed in the dark and after 15-, 60- or 240-min illumination in a wild strain and in a formerly investigated wcoA insertional mutant. Using a threshold of four-fold change in transcript levels, 298 genes were activated and 160 were repressed in the wild strain under at least one of the light exposures. Different response patterns were observed among them, with genes exhibiting either fast, intermediate, and slow photoinduction, or intermediate or slow repression. All the fast and intermediate photoresponses, and most of the slow ones, were lost in the wcoA mutant. However, the wcoA mutation altered the expression of a much larger number of genes irrespective of illumination, reaching at least 16% of the annotated genes in this fungus. Such genes include many related to secondary metabolism, as well as others related to photobiology and other cellular functions, including the production of hydrophobins. As judged by the massive transcriptomic changes exhibited by the wcoA mutant in the dark, the results point to WcoA as a master regulatory protein in F. fujikuroi, in addition to a central function as the photoreceptor responsible for most of the transcriptional responses to light in this fungus.","['Fusarium', 'carotenoids', 'photoreceptor', 'photoregulation', 'secondary metabolism', 'white collar protein']",Frontiers in microbiology,Spain,2020
33297524,"Hex1, the Major Component of Woronin Bodies, Is Required for Normal Development, Pathogenicity, and Stress Response in the Plant Pathogenic Fungus Verticillium dahliae.","Woronin bodies are membrane-bound organelles of filamentous ascomycetes that mediate hyphal compartmentalization by plugging septal pores upon hyphal damage. Their major component is the peroxisomal protein Hex1, which has also been implicated in additional cellular processes in fungi. Here, we analyzed the Hex1 homolog of Verticillium dahliae, an important asexual plant pathogen, and we report its pleiotropic involvement in fungal growth, physiology, stress response, and pathogenicity. Alternative splicing of the Vdhex1 gene can lead to the production of two Hex1 isoforms, which are structurally similar to their Neurospora crassa homolog. We show that VdHex1 is targeted to the septum, consistently with its demonstrated function in sealing hyphal compartments to prevent excessive cytoplasmic bleeding upon injury. Furthermore, our investigation provides direct evidence for significant contributions of Hex1 in growth and morphogenesis, as well as in asexual reproduction capacity. We discovered that Hex1 is required both for normal responses to osmotic stress and factors that affect the cell wall and plasma-membrane integrity, and for normal resistance to oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. The Vdhex1 mutant exhibited diminished ability to colonize and cause disease on eggplant. Overall, we show that Hex1 has fundamentally important multifaceted roles in the biology of V. dahliae.","['ROS', 'heterokaryon incompatibility', 'hyphal integrity', 'septal pore', 'virulence']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",Greece,2020 Dec 7
29387050,Abnormal Ergosterol Biosynthesis Activates Transcriptional Responses to Antifungal Azoles.,"Fungi transcriptionally upregulate expression of azole efflux pumps and ergosterol biosynthesis pathway genes when exposed to antifungal agents that target ergosterol biosynthesis. To date, these transcriptional responses have been shown to be dependent on the presence of the azoles and/or depletion of ergosterol. Using an inducible promoter to regulate Neurospora crassa erg11, which encodes the major azole target, sterol 14alpha-demethylase, we were able to demonstrate that the CDR4 azole efflux pump can be transcriptionally activated by ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition even in the absence of azoles. By analyzing ergosterol deficient mutants, we demonstrate that the transcriptional responses by cdr4 and, unexpectedly, genes encoding ergosterol biosynthesis enzymes (erg genes) that are responsive to azoles, are not dependent on ergosterol depletion. Nonetheless, deletion of erg2, which encodes C-8 sterol isomerase, also induced expression of cdr4. Deletion of erg2 also induced the expression of erg24, the gene encoding C-14 sterol reductase, but not other tested erg genes which were responsive to erg11 inactivation. This indicates that inhibition of specific steps of ergosterol biosynthesis can result in different transcriptional responses, which is further supported by our results obtained using different ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors. Together with the sterol profiles, these results suggest that the transcriptional responses by cdr4 and erg genes are associated with accumulation of specific sterol intermediate(s). This was further supported by the fact that when the erg2 mutant was treated with ketoconazole, upstream inhibition overrode the effects by downstream inhibition on ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. Even though cdr4 expression is associated with the accumulation of sterol intermediates, intra- and extracellular sterol analysis by HPLC-MS indicated that the transcriptional induction of cdr4 did not result in efflux of the accumulated intermediate(s). This study demonstrates, by detailed genetic and chemical analysis, that transcriptional responses by a major efflux pump and genes of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway to ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors can be independent of the presence of the drugs and are linked with the accumulation of ergosterol intermediate(s).","['C-8 sterol isomerase', 'azoles', 'efflux pump', 'sterol 14alpha-demethylase', 'sterol intermediate', 'stress response', 'tcu-1 promoter']",Frontiers in microbiology,China,2018
28145707,Glutamine Amide Flip Elicits Long Distance Allosteric Responses in the LOV Protein Vivid.,"Light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domains sense blue light through the photochemical formation of a cysteinyl-flavin covalent adduct. Concurrent protonation at the flavin N5 position alters the hydrogen bonding interactions of an invariant Gln residue that has been proposed to flip its amide side chain as a critical step in the propagation of conformational change. Traditional molecular dynamics (MD) and replica-exchange MD (REMD) simulations of the well-characterized LOV protein Vivid (VVD) demonstrate that the Gln182 amide indeed reorients by  approximately 180 degrees  in response to either adduct formation or reduction of the isoalloxazine ring to the neutral semiquinone, both of which involve N5 protonation. Free energy simulations reveal that the relative free energies of the flipped Gln conformation and the flipping barrier are significantly lower in the light-adapted state. The Gln182 flip stabilizes an important hinge-bbeta region between the PAS beta-sheet and the N-terminal cap helix that in turn destabilizes an N-terminal latch region against the PAS core. Release of the latch, observed both experimentally and in the simulations, is known to mediate light-induced VVD dimerization. This computational study of a LOV protein, unprecedented in its agreement with experiment, provides an atomistic view of long-range allosteric coupling in a photoreceptor.",?,Journal of the American Chemical Society,Germany,2017 Mar 1
27222014,Gln3 is a main regulator of nitrogen assimilation in Candida glabrata.,"After Candida albicans, the yeast Candida glabrata ranks second as an aetiological agent of candidaemia and is the most frequently encountered non-Candida albicans species in patients with invasive candidiasis. Transcriptome analysis in C. albicans, C. glabrata and Cryptoccocus neoformans has revealed that, when engulfed by macrophages, these yeasts upregulate genes involved in nutrient acquisition, including nitrogen transporters such as the general amino acid permease Gap1, the dicarboxylic amino acid permease Dip5, the basic amino acid permease Can1 and the ammonium permeases Mep1 and Mep2. Nitrogen assimilation has been well studied in model species of fungi, such as Aspergillus nidulans, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, little is known about nitrogen assimilation in C. glabrata. In the present study, we report a major role for Gln3 in the assimilation of glutamine, ammonium and proline. Ure2 also has a role in nitrogen assimilation, but it is only observable in ammonium and glutamine. In addition, Gat1 has a minor role, which is only observable in the absence of Ure2 and Gln3. Gln3 is absolutely necessary for full ammonium uptake from media. We have also shown that MEP2 gene expression in C. glabrata is completely dependent on Gln3, whereas GAP1 regulation is mainly exerted by Gln3, with the exception of proline where Gat1 has a minor role. In addition, in C. glabrata Ure2 appears to be a negative regulator of these NCR-sensitive genes, similarly to what has been described in S. cerevisiae. Our data place Gln3 as a key regulator of nitrogen assimilation.",?,"Microbiology (Reading, England)",Mexico,2016 Aug
23979580,Is the fungus Magnaporthe losing DNA methylation?,"The long terminal repeat retrotransposon, Magnaporthe gypsy-like element (MAGGY), has been shown to be targeted for cytosine methylation in a subset of Magnaporthe oryzae field isolates. Analysis of the F1 progeny from a genetic cross between methylation-proficient (Br48) and methylation-deficient (GFSI1-7-2) isolates revealed that methylation of the MAGGY element was governed by a single dominant gene. Positional cloning followed by gene disruption and complementation experiments revealed that the responsible gene was the DNA methyltransferase, MoDMT1, an ortholog of Neurospora crassa Dim-2. A survey of MAGGY methylation in 60 Magnaporthe field isolates revealed that 42 isolates from rice, common millet, wheat, finger millet, and buffelgrass were methylation proficient while 18 isolates from foxtail millet, green bristlegrass, Japanese panicgrass, torpedo grass, Guinea grass, and crabgrass were methylation deficient. Phenotypic analyses showed that MoDMT1 plays no major role in development and pathogenicity of the fungus. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the average copy number of genomic MAGGY elements was not significantly different between methylation-deficient and -proficient field isolates even though the levels of MAGGY transcript were generally higher in the former group. MoDMT1 gene sequences in the methylation-deficient isolates suggested that at least three independent mutations were responsible for the loss of MoDMT1 function. Overall, our data suggest that MoDMT1 is not essential for the natural life cycle of the fungus and raise the possibility that the genus Magnaporthe may be losing the mechanism of DNA methylation on the evolutionary time scale.","['DNA methylation', 'DNA methyltransferase', 'Magnaporthe oryzae', 'transposon control']",Genetics,Japan,2013 Nov
37107214,The Molecular Chaperone Mechanism of the C-Terminal Domain of Large-Size Subunit Catalases.,"Large-size subunit catalases (LSCs) have an additional C-terminal domain (CT) that is structurally similar to Hsp31 and DJ-1 proteins, which have molecular chaperone activity. The CT of LSCs derives from a bacterial Hsp31 protein. There are two CT dimers with inverted symmetry in LSCs, one dimer in each pole of the homotetrameric structure. We previously demonstrated the molecular chaperone activity of the CT of LSCs. Like other chaperones, LSCs are abundant proteins that are induced under stress conditions and during cell differentiation in bacteria and fungi. Here, we analyze the mechanism of the CT of LSCs as an unfolding enzyme. The dimeric form of catalase-3 (CAT-3) CT (TDC3) of Neurospora crassa presented the highest activity as compared to its monomeric form. A variant of the CAT-3 CT lacking the last 17 amino acid residues (TDC3(Delta17aa)), a loop containing hydrophobic and charged amino acid residues only, lost most of its unfolding activity. Substituting charged for hydrophobic residues or vice versa in this C-terminal loop diminished the molecular chaperone activity in all the mutant variants analyzed, indicating that these amino acid residues play a relevant role in its unfolding activity. These data suggest that the general unfolding mechanism of CAT-3 CT involves a dimer with an inverted symmetry, and hydrophobic and charged amino acid residues. Each tetramer has four sites of interaction with partially unfolded or misfolded proteins. LSCs preserve their catalase activity under different stress conditions and, at the same time, function as unfolding enzymes.","['C-terminal domain', 'chaperone function of hydrophobic and charged amino acid residues', 'large-size subunit catalase', 'molecular chaperones', 'symmetric dimers', 'unfolding enzymes']","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",Mexico,2023 Mar 30
35889076,"Comparative Analysis of Catabolic and Anabolic Dehydroshikimate Dehydratases for 3,4-DHBA Production in Escherichia coli.","The production of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHBA or protocatechuate) is a relevant task owing to 3,4-DHBA's pharmaceutical properties and its use as a precursor for subsequent synthesis of high value-added chemicals. The microbial production of 3,4-DHBA using dehydroshikimate dehydratase (DSD) (EC: 4.2.1.118) has been demonstrated previously. DSDs from soil-dwelling organisms (where DSD is involved in quinate/shikimate degradation) and from Bacillus spp. (synthesizing the 3,4-DHBA-containing siderophore) were compared in terms of the kinetic properties and their ability to produce 3,4-DHBA. Catabolic DSDs from Corynebacterium glutamicum (QsuB) and Neurospora crassa (Qa-4) had higher K(m) (1 and 0.6 mM, respectively) and k(cat) (61 and 220 s(-1), respectively) than biosynthetic AsbF from Bacillus thuringiensis (K(m)~0.04 mM, k(cat)~1 s(-1)). Product inhibition was found to be a crucial factor when choosing DSD for strain development. AsbF was more inhibited by 3,4-DHBA (IC(50)~0.08 mM), and Escherichia coli MG1655 DeltaaroE P(lacUV5)-asbF(attphi80) strain provided only 0.2 g/L 3,4-DHBA in test-tube fermentation.

31534479,Myceliophthora thermophila Xyr1 is predominantly involved in xylan degradation and xylose catabolism.,"BACKGROUND: Myceliophthora thermophila is a thermophilic ascomycete fungus that is used as a producer of enzyme cocktails used in plant biomass saccharification. Further development of this species as an industrial enzyme factory requires a detailed understanding of its regulatory systems driving the production of plant biomass-degrading enzymes. In this study, we analyzed the function of MtXlr1, an ortholog of the (hemi-)cellulolytic regulator XlnR first identified in another industrially relevant fungus, Aspergillus niger. RESULTS: The Mtxlr1 gene was deleted and the resulting strain was compared to the wild type using growth profiling and transcriptomics. The deletion strain was unable to grow on xylan and d-xylose, but showed only a small growth reduction on l-arabinose, and grew similar to the wild type on Avicel and cellulose. These results were supported by the transcriptome analyses which revealed reduction of genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes, enzymes of the pentose catabolic pathway and putative pentose transporters. In contrast, no or minimal effects were observed for the expression of cellulolytic genes. CONCLUSIONS: Myceliophthora thermophila MtXlr1 controls the expression of xylanolytic genes and genes involved in pentose transport and catabolism, but has no significant effects on the production of cellulases. It therefore resembles more the role of its ortholog in Neurospora crassa, rather than the broader role described for this regulator in A. niger and Trichoderma reesei. By revealing the range of genes controlled by MtXlr1, our results provide the basic knowledge for targeted strain improvement by overproducing or constitutively activating this regulator, to further improve the biotechnological value of M. thermophila.","['Cellulose degradation', 'Myceliophthora thermophila', 'Pentose catabolism', 'Xylan degradation', 'Xylanolytic regulator']",Biotechnology for biofuels,The Netherlands.

30779735,Allosteric mechanism of the circadian protein Vivid resolved through Markov state model and machine learning analysis.,"The fungal circadian clock photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) contains a photosensitive allosteric light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domain that undergoes a large N-terminal conformational change. The mechanism by which a blue-light driven covalent bond formation leads to a global conformational change remains unclear, which hinders the further development of VVD as an optogenetic tool. We answered this question through a novel computational platform integrating Markov state models, machine learning methods, and newly developed community analysis algorithms. Applying this new integrative approach, we provided a quantitative evaluation of the contribution from the covalent bond to the protein global conformational change, and proposed an atomistic allosteric mechanism leading to the discovery of the unexpected importance of A'alpha/Abeta and previously overlooked Ealpha/Falpha loops in the conformational change. This approach could be applicable to other allosteric proteins in general to provide interpretable atomistic representations of their otherwise elusive allosteric mechanisms.",?,PLoS computational biology,United States of America,2019 Feb
32743132,A conserved fungal hub protein involved in adhesion and drug resistance in the human pathogen Candida albicans.,"Drug resistance and cellular adhesion are two key elements of both dissemination and prevalence of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Smi1 belongs to a family of hub proteins conserved among the fungal kingdom whose functions in cellular signaling affect morphogenesis, cell wall synthesis and stress resistance. The data presented here indicate that C. albicans SMI1 is a functional homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae KNR4 and is involved in the regulation of cell wall synthesis. Expression of SMI1 in S. cerevisiae knr4Delta null mutants rescued their sensitivity to caspofungin and to heat stress. Deletion of SMI1 in C. albicans resulted in sensitivity to the cell-wall-perturbing compounds Calcofluor White and Caspofungin. Analysis of wild-type and mutant cells by Atomic Force Microscopy showed that the Young's Modulus (stiffness) of the cell wall was reduced by 85% upon deletion of SMI1, while cell surface adhesion measured by Force Spectroscopy showed that the surface expression of adhesive molecules was also reduced in the mutant. Over-expression of SMI1, on the contrary, increased cell surface adhesion by 6-fold vs the control strain. Finally, Smi1-GFP localized as cytoplasmic patches and concentrated spots at the sites of new cell wall synthesis including the tips of growing hyphae, consistent with a role in cell wall regulation. Thus, Smi1 function appears to be conserved across fungi, including the yeast S. cerevisiae, the yeast and hyphal forms of C. albicans and the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.","['Adhesion', 'Atomic Force Microscopy', 'Candida albicans', 'Caspofungin', 'Fungal cell wall']","Cell surface (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",France,2018 Dec
29456549,Global DNA Methylation in the Chestnut Blight Fungus Cryphonectria parasitica and Genome-Wide Changes in DNA Methylation Accompanied with Sectorization.,"Mutation in CpBck1, an ortholog of the cell wall integrity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica resulted in a sporadic sectorization as culture proceeded. The progeny from the sectored area maintained the characteristics of the sector, showing a massive morphogenetic change, including robust mycelial growth without differentiation. Epigenetic changes were investigated as the genetic mechanism underlying this sectorization. Quantification of DNA methylation and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed genome-wide DNA methylation of the wild-type at each nucleotide level and changes in DNA methylation of the sectored progeny. Compared to the wild-type, the sectored progeny exhibited marked genome-wide DNA hypomethylation but increased methylation sites. Expression analysis of two DNA methyltransferases, including two representative types of DNA methyltransferase (DNMTase), demonstrated that both were significantly down-regulated in the sectored progeny. However, functional analysis using mutant phenotypes of corresponding DNMTases demonstrated that a mutant of CpDmt1, an ortholog of RID of Neurospora crassa, resulted in the sectored phenotype but the CpDmt2 mutant did not, suggesting that the genetic basis of fungal sectorization is more complex. The present study revealed that a mutation in a signaling pathway component resulted in sectorization accompanied with changes in genome-wide DNA methylation, which suggests that this signal transduction pathway is important for epigenetic control of sectorization via regulation of genes involved in DNA methylation.","['DNA methylation', 'epigenetics', 'genome-wide association study', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase', 'sectorization', 'whole genome bisulfite sequencing']",Frontiers in plant science,South Korea,2018

Along with 11 molds which fully degraded DCA, several strains were revealed capable of producing cholic acid, ursocholic acid, 12-keto-lithocholic acid (12-keto-LCA), 3-keto-DCA, 15beta-hydroxy-DCA and 15beta-hydroxy-12-oxo-LCA as major products from DCA. The last metabolite was found to be a new compound. The ability to catalyze the introduction of a hydroxyl group at the 7(alpha/beta)-positions of the DCA molecule was shown for 32 strains with the highest 7beta-hydroxylase activity level for Fusarium merismoides VKM F-2310. Curvularia lunata VKM F-644 exhibited 12alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and formed 12-keto-LCA from DCA. Acremonium rutilum VKM F-2853 and Neurospora crassa VKM F-875 produced 15beta-hydroxy-DCA and 15beta-hydroxy-12-oxo-LCA, respectively, as major products from DCA, as confirmed by MS and NMR analyses. For most of the positive strains, the described DCA-transforming activity was unreported to date. The presented results expand the knowledge on bile acid metabolism by filamentous fungi, and might be suitable for preparative-scale exploitation aimed at the production of marketed bile acids.","['7beta-Hydroxylation', 'Bile acid', 'Bioconversion', 'Deoxycholic acid', 'Filamentous fungi', 'Ursocholic acid']",Steroids,Russia,2016 Mar

APSES proteins share a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (APSES domain) of about 100 amino acids, whose central domain is predicted to form a typical bHLH structure. Besides APSES domain, several APSES proteins also contain additional domains, such as KilA-N and ankyrin repeats. In recent years, an increasing number of APSES proteins have been identified from diverse fungi, and they involve in numerous biological processes, such as sporulation, cellular differentiation, mycelial growth, secondary metabolism and virulence. Most fungi, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Candida albicans, Fusarium graminearum, and Neurospora crassa, contain five APSES proteins. However, Cryptococcus neoformans only contains two APSES proteins, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains six APSES proteins. The phylogenetic analysis showed the APSES domains from different fungi were grouped into four clades (A, B, C and D), which is consistent with the result of homologous alignment of APSES domains using DNAman. The roles of APSES proteins in clade C have been studied in detail, while little is known about the roles of other APSES proteins in clades A, B and D.

25428798,Ascomycete fungal actins differentially support plant spatial cell and organ development.,"Actin interacts with a wide variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins to support spatial development in nearly all eukaryotes. Null mutations in plant vegetative actins produce dramatically altered cell, tissue, and organ morphologies. Animal cytoplasmic actins (e.g., human HsACTB, HsACTG1) and some ancestral protist actins fully suppress these mutant phenotypes suggesting that some animal, plant, and protist actins share functional competence for spatial development. Considering that fungi have a phylogenetic origin closer to animals than plants, we were interested to explore whether the fungal actins may have this same capacity to function in plants and support development. We ectopically expressed actins from four highly divergent ascomycete fungi in two different Arabidopsis double vegetative actin null mutants. We found that expression of actin from the earliest diverging ascomycete subphyla, the archiascomycete Schizosaccharomyces pombe, qualitatively and quantitatively suppressed the root cell polarity and root organ developmental defects of act8/act7 mutants and the root-hairless cell elongation phenotype of act2/act8 mutants. Interestingly, the actin from the pyrenomycete Neurospora crassa was modestly effective in the suppression of vegetative actin mutant phenotypes. In contrast, actins from the saccharomycetes Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans were unable to support any aspect of plant development, and moreover induced severe dwarfism and sterility. These data imply that basal fungi inherited an actin with full competence for spatial development from their protist ancestor and maintained it via non-progressive sequence evolution, while the later more derived fungal species lost these activities.","['Arabidopsis thaliana', 'actin mutants', 'ectopic expression', 'root development', 'root hair growth', 'vegetative actins', 'yeast actins']","Cytoskeleton (Hoboken, N.J.)",Georgia,2015 Feb

EGT is primarily synthesized by fungal species and a number of bacterial species. A five-gene cluster (egtA, egtB, egtC, egtD &egtE) responsible for EGT production in Mycobacteria smegmatis has recently been identified. The first fungal biosynthetic EGT gene (NcEgt-1) has also been identified in Neurospora crassa. NcEgt-1 contains domains similar to those found in M. smegmatis egtB and egtD. EGT is biomembrane impermeable. Here we inferred the evolutionary history of the EGT cluster in prokaryotes as well as examining the phyletic distribution of Egt-1 in the fungal kingdom. A genomic survey of 2509 prokaryotes showed that the five-gene EGT cluster is only found in the Actinobacteria. Our survey identified more than 400 diverse prokaryotes that contain genetically linked orthologs of egtB and egtD. Phylogenetic analyses of Egt proteins show a complex evolutionary history and multiple incidences of horizontal gene transfer. Our analysis also identified two independent incidences of a fusion event of egtB and egtD in bacterial species. A genomic survey of over 100 fungal genomes shows that Egt-1 is found in all fungal phyla, except species that belong to the Saccharomycotina subphylum. This analysis provides a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the key genes involved in the synthesis of EGT in prokaryotes and fungi.

The catalytic domain is conserved at both primary sequence and structural levels and its amino acid composition is optimized to select H(2)O(2) over water. The CT is structurally conserved, has an amino acid composition similar to very stable proteins, confers high stability to LSCs, and has independent molecular chaperone activity. While heat and denaturing agents increased Neurospora crassa catalase-1 (CAT-1) activity, a CAT-1 version lacking the CT (C63) was no longer activated by these agents. The addition of catalase-3 (CAT-3) CT to the CAT-1 or CAT-3 catalase domains prevented their heat denaturation in vitro. Protein structural alignments indicated CT similarity with members of the DJ-1/PfpI superfamily and the CT dimers present in LSCs constitute a new type of symmetric dimer within this superfamily. However, only the bacterial Hsp31 proteins show sequence similarity to the bacterial and fungal catalase mobile coil (MC) and are phylogenetically related to MC_CT sequences. LSCs might have originated by fusion of SSC and Hsp31 encoding genes during early bacterial diversification, conferring at the same time great stability and molecular chaperone activity to the novel catalases.","['C-terminal domain', 'Hsp31', 'amino acid frequency', 'catalytic activation', 'evolution of catalases', 'heat stability', 'large-size subunit catalase', 'molecular chaperone']","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",Mexico,2022 May 17
34695687,A cytochrome b-glucose dehydrogenase chimeric enzyme capable of direct electron transfer.,"The development of third generation biosensors depends on the availability of direct electron transfer (DET) capable enzymes. A successful strategy is to fuse a cytochrome domain to an enzyme to fulfil the function of a built-in redox mediator between the catalytic center and the electrode. In this study, we fused the cytochrome domain of Neurospora crassa CDH IIA (NcCYT) N-terminally to glucose dehydrogenase from Glomerella cingulata (GcGDH) to generate the chimeric enzyme NcCYT-GcGDH in a large amount for further studies. Heterologous expression in P. pastoris and chromatographic purification resulted in 1.8 g of homogeneous chimeric enzyme. Biochemical and electrochemical characterization confirmed that the chimeric enzyme is catalytically active, able to perform interdomain electron transfer (IET) and direct electron transfer (DET) via the fused cytochrome domain. The midpoint redox potential of the fused b-type cytochrome is 91 mV vs. SHE at pH 6.5 and the specific current obtained on a porous graphite electrode is 2.3 muA cm(-2). The high current obtained on this simple, unmodified electrode at a rather low redox potential is a promising starting point for further optimization.

34093501,Identifying Genes Devoted to the Cell Death Process in the Gene Regulatory Network of Ustilago maydis.,"Cell death is a process that can be divided into three morphological patterns: apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis. In fungi, cell death is induced in response to intracellular and extracellular perturbations, such as plant defense molecules, toxins and fungicides, among others. Ustilago maydis is a dimorphic fungus used as a model for pathogenic fungi of animals, including humans, and plants. Here, we reconstructed the transcriptional regulatory network of U. maydis, through homology inferences by using as templates the well-known gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. Based on this GRN, we identified transcription factors (TFs) as hubs and functional modules and calculated diverse topological metrics. In addition, we analyzed exhaustively the module related to cell death, with 60 TFs and 108 genes, where diverse cell proliferation, mating-type switching and meiosis, among other functions, were identified. To determine the role of some of these genes, we selected a set of 11 genes for expression analysis by qRT-PCR (sin3, rlm1, aif1, tdh3 [isoform A], tdh3 [isoform B], ald4, mca1, nuc1, tor1, ras1, and atg8) whose homologues in other fungi have been described as central in cell death. These genes were identified as downregulated at 72 h, in agreement with the beginning of the cell death process. Our results can serve as the basis for the study of transcriptional regulation, not only of the cell death process but also of all the cellular processes of U. maydis.","['U. maydis', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'cell death', 'necrosis', 'regulatory networks', 'transcription factors']",Frontiers in microbiology,Mexico,2021

Here, we identify two new partners of this pathway: PaPro1, a transcription factor orthologous to Sordaria macrospora pro1 and Neurospora crassa ADV-1, and IDC4, a protein with an AIM24 domain. Both PaPro1 and IDC4 regulate stationary phase features, as described for the other actors of the PaMpk1 signaling pathway. However, PaPro1 is also involved in the control of fertilization by activating the transcription of the HMG8 and the mating type transcription factors, as well as the sexual pheromones and receptor genes. The roles of two components of the STRIPAK complex were also investigated by inactivating their encoding genes: PaPro22 and PaPro45. The mutants of these genes were found to have the same phenotypes as PaPro1 and IDC4 mutants as well as additional phenotypes including slow growth, abnormally shaped hyphae, pigment accumulation and blockage of the zygotic tissue development, indicating that the STRIPAK complex regulates, in addition to the PaMpk1 one, other pathways in P. anserina.

These compounds are of major interest because of their (potential) application in medicine and biotechnology and as a potential source for new therapeutic agents and drug leads. However, under laboratory conditions, most secondary metabolism genes remain silent. This circumstance is an obstacle for the production of known metabolites and the discovery of new secondary metabolites. In this study, we describe the dual role of the transcription factor Xylanase promoter binding protein 1 (Xpp1) in the regulation of both primary and secondary metabolism of Trichoderma reesei Xpp1 was previously described as a repressor of xylanases. Here, we provide data from an RNA-sequencing analysis suggesting that Xpp1 is an activator of primary metabolism. This finding is supported by our results from a Biolog assay determining the carbon source assimilation behavior of an xpp1 deletion strain. Furthermore, the role of Xpp1 as a repressor of secondary metabolism is shown by gene expression analyses of polyketide synthases and the determination of the secondary metabolites of xpp1 deletion and overexpression strains using an untargeted metabolomics approach. The deletion of Xpp1 resulted in the enhanced secretion of secondary metabolites in terms of diversity and quantity. Homologs of Xpp1 are found among a broad range of fungi, including the biocontrol agent Trichoderma atroviride, the plant pathogens Fusarium graminearum and Colletotrichum graminicola, the model organism Neurospora crassa, the human pathogen Sporothrix schenckii, and the ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea.","['fungi', 'gene regulation', 'low molecular compounds', 'secondary metabolism', 'transcription factor']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Austria,2017 Jan 24
27353331,Homology directed repair is unaffected by the absence of siRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) defend the organism against harmful transcripts from exogenous (e.g. viral) or endogenous (e.g. transposons) sources. Recent publications describe the production of siRNAs induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in Neurospora crassa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and human cells, which suggests a conserved function. A current hypothesis is that break-induced small RNAs ensure efficient homologous recombination (HR). However, biogenesis of siRNAs is often intertwined with other small RNA species, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), which complicates interpretation of experimental results. In Drosophila, siRNAs are produced by Dcr-2 while miRNAs are processed by Dcr-1. Thus, it is possible to probe siRNA function without miRNA deregulation. We therefore examined DNA double-strand break repair after perturbation of siRNA biogenesis in cultured Drosophila cells as well as mutant flies. Our assays comprised reporters for the single-strand annealing pathway, homologous recombination and sensitivity to the DSB-inducing drug camptothecin. We could not detect any repair defects caused by the lack of siRNAs derived from the broken DNA locus. Since production of these siRNAs depends on local transcription, they may thus participate in RNA metabolism-an established function of siRNAs-rather than DNA repair.",?,Nucleic acids research,Germany,2016 Sep 30
34000197,Ag-Doped and Antibiotic-Loaded Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoparticles as Promising Carriers to Fight Different Pathogens.,"Utilization of antibacterial components-conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) is emerging as an attractive strategy for combating various pathogens. Herein, we demonstrate that Ag/BN NPs and antibiotic-loaded BN and Ag/BN nanoconjugates are promising carriers to fight bacterial and fungal infections. Extensive biological tests included two types of Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (B8469 and MW2), two types of Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (ATCC27853 and B1307/17), and 47 types of Escherichia coli strains (including 41 multidrug-resistant ones), as well as five types of fungal cultures: Candida albicans (candidiasis-thrush) ATCC90028 and ATCC24433, Candida parapsilosis ATCC90018, Candida auris CBS109113, and Neurospora crassa wt. We have demonstrated that, even within a single genus Escherichia, there are many hospital E. coli strains with multi-drug resistance to different antibiotics. Gentamicin-loaded BN NPs have high bactericidal activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and 38 types of the E. coli strains. For the rest of the tested E. coli strains, the Ag nanoparticle-containing nanohybrids have shown superior bactericidal efficiency. The Ag/BN nanohybrids and amphotericin B-loaded BN and Ag/BN NPs also reveal high fungicidal activity against C. albicans, C. auris, C. parapsilosis, and N. crassa cells. In addition, based on the density functional theory calculations, the nature of antibiotic-nanoparticle interaction, the sorption capacity of the BN and Ag/BN nanohybrids for gentamicin and amphotericin B, and the most energetically favorable positions of the drug molecules relative to the carrier surface, which lead to lowest binding energies, have been determined. The obtained results clearly show high therapeutic potential of the antibiotic-loaded Ag/BN nanocarriers providing a broad bactericidal and fungicidal protection against all of the studied pathogens.","['Ag ion release', 'BN nanoparticles', 'BN-Ag nanohybrids', 'antibacterial activity', 'antibiotic release', 'antifungal activity']",ACS applied materials & interfaces,Russia,2021 May 26
28533816,Conferring cellulose-degrading ability to Yarrowia lipolytica to facilitate a consolidated bioprocessing approach.,"BACKGROUND: Yarrowia lipolytica, one of the most widely studied ""nonconventional"" oleaginous yeast species, is unable to grow on cellulose. Recently, we identified and overexpressed two endogenous beta-glucosidases in Y. lipolytica, thus enabling this yeast to use cello-oligosaccharides as a carbon source for growth. Using this engineered yeast platform, we have now gone further toward building a fully cellulolytic Y. lipolytica for use in consolidated bioprocessing of cellulose. RESULTS: Initially, different essential enzyme components of a cellulase cocktail (i.e,. cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases) were individually expressed in Y. lipolytica in order to ascertain the viability of the strategy. Accordingly, the Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I (TrEG I) and II (TrEG II) were secreted as active proteins in Y. lipolytica, with the secretion yield of EG II being twice that of EG I. Characterization of the purified His-tagged recombinant EG proteins (rhTrEGs) revealed that rhTrEG I displayed higher specific activity than rhTrEG II on both cellotriose and insoluble cellulosic substrates, such as Avicel, beta-1, 3 glucan, beta-1, 4 glucan, and PASC. Similarly, cellobiohydrolases, such as T. reesei CBH I and II (TrCBH I and II), and the CBH I from Neurospora crassa (NcCBH I) were successfully expressed in Y. lipolytica. However, the yield of the expressed TrCBH I was low, so work on this was not pursued. Contrastingly, rhNcCBH I was not only well expressed, but also highly active on PASC and more active on Avicel (0.11 U/mg) than wild-type TrCBH I (0.065 U/mg). Therefore, work was pursued using a combination of NcCBH I and TrCBH II. The quantification of enzyme levels in culture supernatants revealed that the use of a hybrid promoter instead of the primarily used TEF promoter procured four and eight times more NcCBH I and TrCBH II expressions, respectively. Finally, the coexpression of the previously described Y. lipolytica beta-glucosidases, the CBH II, and EG I and II from T. reesei, and the N. crassa CBH I procured an engineered Y. lipolytica strain that was able to grow both on model cellulose substrates, such as highly crystalline Avicel, and on industrial cellulose pulp, such as that obtained using an organosolv process. CONCLUSIONS: A Y. lipolytica strain coexpressing six cellulolytic enzyme components has been successfully developed. In addition, the results presented show how the recombinant strain can be optimized, for example, using artificial promoters to tailor expression levels. Most significantly, this study has provided a demonstration of how the strain can grow on a sample of industrial cellulose as sole carbon source, thus revealing the feasibility of Yarrowia-based consolidated bioprocess for the production of fuel and chemical precursors. Further, enzyme and strain optimization, coupled to appropriate process design, will undoubtedly lead to much better performances in the future.","['Cellobiohydrolase', 'Cellulase', 'Cellulolytic biocatalyst', 'Cellulose', 'Consolidated bioprocessing', 'Endoglucanase', 'Yarrowia lipolytica', 'beta-Glucosidase']",Biotechnology for biofuels,France.

31816399,CLR1 and CLR2 are light dependent regulators of xylanase and pectinase genes in Trichoderma reesei.,"Regulation of plant cell wall degradation is of utmost importance for understanding the carbon cycle in nature, but also to improve industrial processes aimed at enzyme production for next generation biofuels. Thereby, the transcription factor networks in different fungi show conservation as well as striking differences, particularly between Trichoderma reesei and Neurospora crassa. Here, we aimed to gain insight into the function of the transcription factors CLR1 and CLR2 in T. reesei, which are crucial for cellulase gene expression in N. crassa. We studied impacts on gene regulation with cellulose, xylan, pectin and chitin, growth on 95 different carbon sources as well as an involvement in regulation of secondary metabolism or development. We found that CLR1 is present in the genome of T. reesei and other Trichoderma spp., albeit with considerably lower homology compared to other ascomycetes. CLR1 and CLR2 regulate pectinase transcript levels upon growth on pectin, no major function was detected on chitin. CLR1 and CLR2 form a positive feedback cycle on xylan and were found to be responsible for balancing co-regulation of xylanase genes in light and darkness with distinct and in part opposite regulatory effects of up to 8fold difference. Our data suggest that CLR1 and CLR2 have evolved differently in T. reesei compared to other fungi. We propose a model in which their main function is in adjustment of regulation of xylanase gene expression to different light conditions and to balance transcript levels of genes involved in plant cell wall degradation according to their individual relevance for this process.","['Cellulase gene expression', 'Coregulation', 'Hypocrea jecorina', 'Light response', 'Pectinase', 'Plant cell wall degradation', 'Trichoderma reesei', 'Xylanase']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Austria.

36566249,Regulatory basis for reproductive flexibility in a meningitis-causing fungal pathogen.,"Pathogenic fungi of the genus Cryptococcus can undergo two sexual cycles, involving either bisexual diploidization (after fusion of haploid cells of different mating type) or unisexual diploidization (by autodiploidization of a single cell). Here, we construct a gene-deletion library for 111 transcription factor genes in Cryptococcus deneoformans, and explore the roles of these regulatory networks in the two reproductive modes. We show that transcription factors crucial for bisexual syngamy induce the expression of known mating determinants as well as other conserved genes of unknown function. Deletion of one of these genes, which we term FMP1, leads to defects in bisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans, its sister species Cryptococcus neoformans, and the ascomycete Neurospora crassa. Furthermore, we show that a recently evolved regulatory cascade mediates pre-meiotic unisexual autodiploidization, supporting that this reproductive process is a recent evolutionary innovation. Our findings indicate that genetic circuits with different evolutionary ages govern hallmark events distinguishing unisexual and bisexual reproduction in Cryptococcus.",?,Nature communications,China,2022 Dec 24
28049705,An Evolutionarily Conserved Transcriptional Activator-Repressor Module Controls Expression of Genes for D-Galacturonic Acid Utilization in Aspergillus niger.,"The expression of genes encoding extracellular polymer-degrading enzymes and the metabolic pathways required for carbon utilization in fungi are tightly controlled. The control is mediated by transcription factors that are activated by the presence of specific inducers, which are often monomers or monomeric derivatives of the polymers. A D-galacturonic acid-specific transcription factor named GaaR was recently identified and shown to be an activator for the expression of genes involved in galacturonic acid utilization in Botrytis cinerea and Aspergillus niger Using a forward genetic screen, we isolated A. niger mutants that constitutively express GaaR-controlled genes. Reasoning that mutations in the gaaR gene would lead to a constitutively activated transcription factor, the gaaR gene in 11 of the constitutive mutants was sequenced, but no mutations in gaaR were found. Full genome sequencing of five constitutive mutants revealed allelic mutations in one particular gene encoding a previously uncharacterized protein (NRRL3_08194). The protein encoded by NRRL3_08194 shows homology to the repressor of the quinate utilization pathway identified previously in Neurospora crassa (qa-1S) and Aspergillus nidulans (QutR). Deletion of NRRL3_08194 in combination with RNA-seq analysis showed that the NRRL3_08194 deletion mutant constitutively expresses genes involved in galacturonic acid utilization. Interestingly, NRRL3_08194 is located next to gaaR (NRRL3_08195) in the genome. The homology to the quinate repressor, the chromosomal clustering, and the constitutive phenotype of the isolated mutants suggest that NRRL3_08194 is likely to encode a repressor, which we name GaaX. The GaaR-GaaX module and its chromosomal organization is conserved among ascomycetes filamentous fungi, resembling the quinate utilization activator-repressor module in amino acid sequence and chromosomal organization.","['galacturonic acid', 'gene regulation', 'genomics', 'pectin', 'repressor protein', 'transcriptomics']",Genetics,The Netherlands,2017 Jan
27578449,Deep sequencing of mycovirus-derived small RNAs from Botrytis species.,"RNA silencing is an ancient regulatory mechanism operating in all eukaryotic cells. In fungi, it was first discovered in Neurospora crassa, although its potential as a defence mechanism against mycoviruses was first reported in Cryphonectria parasitica and, later, in several fungal species. There is little evidence of the antiviral potential of RNA silencing in the phytopathogenic species of the fungal genus Botrytis. Moreover, little is known about the RNA silencing components in these fungi, although the analysis of public genome databases identified two Dicer-like genes in B. cinerea, as in most of the ascomycetes sequenced to date. In this work, we used deep sequencing to study the virus-derived small RNA (vsiRNA) populations from different mycoviruses infecting field isolates of Botrytis spp. The mycoviruses under study belong to different genera and species, and have different types of genome [double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), (+)single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and (-)ssRNA]. In general, vsiRNAs derived from mycoviruses are mostly of 21, 20 and 22 nucleotides in length, possess sense or antisense orientation, either in a similar ratio or with a predominance of sense polarity depending on the virus species, have predominantly U at their 5' end, and are unevenly distributed along the viral genome, showing conspicuous hotspots of vsiRNA accumulation. These characteristics reveal striking similarities with vsiRNAs produced by plant viruses, suggesting similar pathways of viral targeting in plants and fungi. We have shown that the fungal RNA silencing machinery acts against the mycoviruses used in this work in a similar manner independent of their viral or fungal origin.","['antiviral RNA silencing, Botrytis', 'mycoviruses', 'quelling', 'small RNAs']",Molecular plant pathology,Spain,2017 Oct
25356841,The transcription factor Ste12 mediates the regulatory role of the Tmk1 MAP kinase in mycoparasitism and vegetative hyphal fusion in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma atroviride.,"Mycoparasitic species of the fungal genus Trichoderma are potent antagonists able to combat plant pathogenic fungi by direct parasitism. An essential step in this mycoparasitic fungus-fungus interaction is the detection of the fungal host followed by activation of molecular weapons in the mycoparasite by host-derived signals. The Trichoderma atroviride MAP kinase Tmk1, a homolog of yeast Fus3/Kss1, plays an essential role in regulating the mycoparasitic host attack, aerial hyphae formation and conidiation. However, the transcription factors acting downstream of Tmk1 are hitherto unknown. Here we analyzed the functions of the T. atroviride Ste12 transcription factor whose orthologue in yeast is targeted by the Fus3 and Kss1 MAP kinases. Deletion of the ste12 gene in T. atroviride not only resulted in reduced mycoparasitic overgrowth and lysis of host fungi but also led to loss of hyphal avoidance in the colony periphery and a severe reduction in conidial anastomosis tube formation and vegetative hyphal fusion events. The transcription of several orthologues of Neurospora crassa hyphal fusion genes was reduced upon ste12 deletion; however, the Deltaste12 mutant showed enhanced expression of mycoparasitism-relevant chitinolytic and proteolytic enzymes and of the cell wall integrity MAP kinase Tmk2. Based on the comparative analyses of Deltaste12 and Deltatmk1 mutants, an essential role of the Ste12 transcriptional regulator in mediating outcomes of the Tmk1 MAPK pathway such as regulation of the mycoparasitic activity, hyphal fusion and carbon source-dependent vegetative growth is suggested. Aerial hyphae formation and conidiation, in contrast, were found to be independent of Ste12.",?,PloS one,Austria,2014
36175923,Construction and yield optimization of a cinnamylamine biosynthesis route in Escherichia coli.,"BACKGROUND: With the development of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds has attracted much attention. Cinnamylamine is an aromatic compound derived from L-phenylalanine, which is used in the synthesis of biologically active molecules, including drugs, and energetic materials. Cinnamylamine has been mainly synthesized by chemical methods to date, and few reports have focused on the biosynthesis of cinnamylamine. Therefore, it is desirable to establish an efficient biosynthesis method for cinnamylamine. RESULTS: The omega-aminotransferase Cv-omegaTA from Chromobacterium violaceum has been demonstrated to have high enzyme activity in the conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamylamine. To prevent the preferable conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol in wild-type Escherichia coli, the E. coli MG1655 strain with reduced aromatic aldehyde reduction (RARE) in which six aldehyde ketone reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes have been knocked out was employed. Then, the carboxylic acid reductase from Neurospora crassa (NcCAR) and phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) from E. coli were screened for a high conversion rate of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde. To shift the equilibrium of the reaction toward cinnamylamine, saturation mutagenesis of Cv-omegaTA at key amino acid residues was performed, and Cv-omegaTA Y168G had the highest conversion rate with 88.56 mg/L cinnamylamine obtained after 4 h of fermentation. Finally, by optimizing the substrates and the supply of the cofactors, PLP and NADPH, in the fermentation, the yield of cinnamylamine in engineered E. coli reached 523.15 mg/L. CONCLUSION: We achieved the first biosynthesis of cinnamylamine using cinnamic acid as the precursor in E. coli using a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy. This study provides a reference for the biosynthesis of other amine compounds and lays a foundation for the de novo synthesis of cinnamylamine.","['Cinnamic acid', 'Cinnamylamine biosynthesis', 'Escherichia coli', 'Metabolic engineering', 'omega-Aminotransferase']",Biotechnology for biofuels and bioproducts,People's Republic of China,2022 Sep 29
34379190,Unveiling the structure of GPI-anchored protein of Malassezia globosa and its pathogenic role in pityriasis versicolor.,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI)-anchored proteins (GpiPs) are related to the cell wall biogenesis, adhesion, interactions, protease activity, mating, etc. These proteins have been identified in many organisms, including fungi such as Neurospora crassa, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Fusarium graminearum. MGL-3153 gene of Malassezia globosa (M. globosa) encodes a protein which is homologous of the M. restricta, M. sympodialis, M. Pachydermatis, and U. maydis GpiPs. Real-time PCR assay showed that the expression of MGL_3153 gene was significantly up-regulated among M. globosa isolated from patients with pityriasis versicolor (PV) compared to a healthy individual, suggesting the contribution of this gene in the virulence of M. globosa. Accordingly, the sequence of this protein was analyzed by bioinformatics tools to evaluate the structure of that. The conservation analysis of MGL-3153 protein showed that the C-terminal region of this protein, which is responsible for GPI-anchor ligation, was highly conserved during evolution while the N-terminal region just conserved in Malassezia species. Moreover, the predicted tertiary structure of this protein by homology modeling showed that this protein almost has alpha helix structure and represented a stable structure during 150 ns of molecular dynamic simulation. Our results revealed that this protein potentially belongs to GPI-anchored proteins and may contribute to the virulence of M. globosa which warrants further investigations in this area.","['GPI-anchored protein', 'Homology modeling', 'Malassezia globosa', 'Molecular dynamic simulation', 'Phylogenetic', 'Virulence factor']",Journal of molecular modeling,Iran.

33489432,Chimeric Cellobiose Dehydrogenases Reveal the Function of Cytochrome Domain Mobility for the Electron Transfer to Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase.,"The natural function of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to donate electrons from its catalytic flavodehydrogenase (DH) domain via its cytochrome (CYT) domain to lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) is an example of a highly efficient extracellular electron transfer chain. To investigate the function of the CYT domain movement in the two occurring electron transfer steps, two CDHs from the ascomycete Neurospora crassa (NcCDHIIA and NcCDHIIB) and five chimeric CDH enzymes created by domain swapping were studied in combination with the fungus' own LPMOs (NcLPMO9C and NcLPMO9F). Kinetic and electrochemical methods and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry were used to study the domain movement, interaction, and electron transfer kinetics. Molecular docking provided insights into the protein-protein interface, the orientation of domains, and binding energies. We find that the first, interdomain electron transfer step from the catalytic site in the DH domain to the CYT domain depends on steric and electrostatic interface complementarity and the length of the protein linker between both domains but not on the redox potential difference between the FAD and heme b cofactors. After CYT reduction, a conformational change of CDH from its closed state to an open state allows the second, interprotein electron transfer (IPET) step from CYT to LPMO to occur by direct interaction of the b-type heme and the type-2 copper center. Chimeric CDH enzymes favor the open state and achieve higher IPET rates by exposing the heme b cofactor to LPMO. The IPET, which is influenced by interface complementarity and the heme b redox potential, is very efficient with bimolecular rates between 2.9 x 10(5) and 1.1 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1).",?,ACS catalysis,Austria,2021 Jan 15
32634260,A nuclear protein NsiA from Epichloe festucae interacts with a MAP kinase MpkB and regulates the expression of genes required for symbiotic infection and hyphal cell fusion.,"The endophytic fungus Epichloe festucae systemically colonizes the intercellular spaces of cool-season grasses to establish a mutualistic symbiosis. Hyphal growth of the endophyte within the host plant is tightly regulated and synchronized with the growth of the host plant. A genetic screen to identify symbiotic genes identified mutant FR405 that had an antagonistic interaction with the host plant. Perennial ryegrass infected with the FR405 mutant were stunted and underwent premature senescence and death. The disrupted gene in FR405 encodes a nuclear-localized protein, designated as NsiA for nuclear protein for symbiotic infection. Like previously isolated symbiotic mutants the nsiA mutant is defective in hyphal cell fusion. NsiA interacts with Ste12, a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor, and a MAP kinase MpkB. Both are known as essential components for cell fusion in other fungal species. In E. festucae, MpkB, but not Ste12, is essential for cell fusion. Expression of several genes required for cell fusion and symbiosis, including proA/adv-1, pro41/ham-6, ham7, ham8, and ham9 were downregulated in the nsiA mutant. However, the NsiA ortholog in Neurospora crassa was not essential for hyphal cell fusion. These results demonstrate that the roles of NsiA and Ste12 orthologs in hyphal cell fusion are distinctive between fungal species.","['Epichloe festucae', 'cell fusion', 'endophyte', 'symbiosis']",Molecular microbiology,Japan,2020 Oct
29062053,Spontaneous circadian rhythms in a cold-adapted natural isolate of Aureobasidium pullulans.,"Circadian systems enable organisms to synchronize their physiology to daily and seasonal environmental changes relying on endogenous pacemakers that oscillate with a period close to 24 h even in the absence of external timing cues. The oscillations are achieved by intracellular transcriptional/translational feedback loops thoroughly characterized for many organisms, but still little is known about the presence and characteristics of circadian clocks in fungi other than Neurospora crassa. We sought to characterize the circadian system of a natural isolate of Aureobasidium pullulans, a cold-adapted yeast bearing great biotechnological potential. A. pullulans formed daily concentric rings that were synchronized by light/dark cycles and were also formed in constant darkness with a period of 24.5 h. Moreover, these rhythms were temperature compensated, as evidenced by experiments conducted at temperatures as low as 10  degrees C. Finally, the expression of clock-essential genes, frequency, white collar-1, white collar-2 and vivid was confirmed. In summary, our results indicate the existence of a functional circadian clock in A. pullulans, capable of sustaining rhythms at very low temperatures and, based on the presence of conserved clock-gene homologues, suggest a molecular and functional relationship to well-described circadian systems.",?,Scientific reports,Argentina,2017 Oct 23
36823535,Synergistic improvement of cinnamylamine production by metabolic regulation.,"BACKGROUND: Aromatic primary amines (APAs) are key intermediates in the chemical industry with numerous applications. Efficient and mild biocatalytic synthesis is an excellent complement to traditional chemical synthesis. Our lab previously reported a whole-cell catalytic system for the synthesis of APAs catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase from Neurospora crassa (ncCAR) and omega-transaminase from Ochrobactrum anthropi (OATA). However, the accumulation of toxic intermediates (aromatic aldehydes) during biocatalytic synthesis affected yields of APAs due to metabolic imbalance. RESULTS: In this work, the biocatalytic synthesis of APAs (taking cinnamylamine as an example) was metabolically regulated by the overexpression or knockout of five native global transcription factors (TFs), the overexpression of eight native resistance genes, and optimization of promoters. Transcriptome analysis showed that knockout of the TF arcA increased the fluxes of NADPH and ATP in E. coli, while the rate of pyruvate metabolism was accelerated. In addition, the genes related to stress and detoxification were upregulated with the overexpression of resistance gene marA, which reduced the NADPH level in E. coli. Then, the expression level of soluble OATA increased by promoter optimization. Overall, arcA and marA could regulate the catalytic rate of NADPH- dependent ncCAR, while arcA and optimized promoter could regulate the catalytic rate of OATA. Lastly, the cinnamylamine yield of the best metabolically engineered strain S020 was increased to 90% (9 mM, 1.2 g/L), and the accumulation of cinnamaldehyde was below 0.9 mM. This work reported the highest production of cinnamylamine by biocatalytic synthesis. CONCLUSION: This regulatory process provides a common strategy for regulating the biocatalytic synthesis of other APAs. Being entirely biocatalytic, our one-pot procedure provides considerable advantages in terms of environmental and safety impacts over reported chemical methods.","['Cinnamylamine', 'Escherichia coli', 'Metabolic engineering', 'One-pot', 'Transcriptome analysis', 'Whole-cell catalysis']",Journal of biological engineering,P.R.

A total of 25 endophytic fungi were isolated from the 90 tissue fragments of Euphorbia hirta (L) and identified based on morphological and microscopical characteristics. All the fungal isolates were screened for Lovastatin production using Neurospora crassa bioassay. Among the 25 fungal isolates, Fusarium sp2, Nigrospora sphaerica, and Fusarium sp 4 showed maximum zone of inhibition and they were further verified by Thin Layer Chromatography. Since the R(f) values of Fusarium sp 4 and standard Lovastatin were the same, further characterization was preceded only with Fusarium sp 4. An evolutionary relationship of two positive isolates, Fusarium sp 2 and Fusarium sp 4 was studied with other Lovastatin-producing fungi. Gene sequencing and BLAST revealed that a novel fungus, Fusarium sp 4 was found to be Fusarium nectrioides (MH173849) and it was further used for batch fermentation of Lovastatin in the modified media using liquid cheese whey under controlled conditions, which enhanced the productivity up to 43.40 mug/mL with the minimum purification steps. LC-MS-MS and NMR studies confirmed the production of Lovastatin by F. nectrioides (MH173849) due to the presence of Pyran molecule hydrogen, Hydrogen fusing two molecules as intermediate with triplet signal groups, methylbutanoic acid, and hexahydro naphthalene.

35870147,AaCaM is required for infection structure differentiation and secondary metabolites in pear fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata.,"AIMS: Calmodulin (CaM), acts as a kind of multifunctional Ca(2+) sensing protein, which is ubiquitous in fungi, is highly conserved across eukaryotes and is involved in the regulation of a range of physiological processes, including morphogenesis, reproduction and secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Our aim was to understand the characteristics and functions of AaCaM in Alternaria alternata, the causal agent of pear black spot. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 450 bp cDNA sequence of AaCaM gene of A. alternata was cloned by the PCR homology method. Sequence analysis showed that this protein encoded by AaCaM was a stable hydrophilic protein and had a high similarity to Neurospora crassa (CAA50271.1) and other fungi. RT-qPCR analysis determined that AaCaM was differentially upregulated during infection structural differentiation of A. alternata both on hydrophobic and pear wax extract-coated surface, with a 3.37-fold upregulation during the hydrophobic induced appressorium formation period (6 h) and a 1.46-fold upregulation during the infection hyphae formation period (8 h) following pear wax induction. Pharmaceutical analysis showed that the CaM-specific inhibitor, trifluoperazine (TFP), inhibited spore germination and appressorium formation, and affected toxins and melanin biosynthesis in A. alternata. CONCLUSIONS: AaCaM plays an important role in regulating infection structure differentiation and secondary metabolism of A. alternata.

35666721,A role for the mitotic proteins Bub3 and BuGZ in transcriptional regulation of catalase-3 expression.,"The spindle assembly checkpoint factors Bub3 and BuGZ play critical roles in mitotic process, but little is known about their roles in other cellular processes in eukaryotes. In aerobic organisms, transcriptional regulation of catalase genes in response to developmental or environmental stimuli is necessary for redox homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that Bub3 and BuGZ negatively regulate cat-3 transcription in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The absence of Bub3 caused a significant decrease in BuGZ protein levels. Our data indicate that BuGZ and Bub3 interact directly via the GLEBS domain of BuGZ. Despite loss of the interaction, the amount of BuGZ mutant protein negatively correlated with the cat-3 expression level, indicating that BuGZ amount rather than Bub3-BuGZ interaction determines cat-3 transcription level. Further experiments demonstrated that BuGZ binds directly to the cat-3 gene and responses to cat-3 overexpression induced by oxidative stresses. However, the zinc finger domains of BuGZ have no effects on DNA binding, although mutations of these highly conserved domains lead to loss of cat-3 repression. The deposition of BuGZ along cat-3 chromatin hindered the recruitment of transcription activators GCN4/CPC1 and NC2 complex, thereby preventing the assembly of the transcriptional machinery. Taken together, our results establish a mechanism for how mitotic proteins Bub3 and BuGZ functions in transcriptional regulation in a eukaryotic organism.",?,PLoS genetics,China,2022 Jun
35204167,Cell-Free Protein Synthesis with Fungal Lysates for the Rapid Production of Unspecific Peroxygenases.,"Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs, EC 1.11.2.1) are fungal biocatalysts that have attracted considerable interest for application in chemical syntheses due to their ability to selectively incorporate peroxide-oxygen into non-activated hydrocarbons. However, the number of available and characterized UPOs is limited, as it is difficult to produce these enzymes in homologous or hetero-logous expression systems. In the present study, we introduce a third approach for the expression of UPOs: cell-free protein synthesis using lysates from filamentous fungi. Biomass of Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus niger, respectively, was lysed by French press and tested for translational activity with a luciferase reporter enzyme. The upo1 gene from Cyclocybe (Agrocybe) aegerita (encoding the main peroxygenase, AaeUPO) was cell-free expressed with both lysates, reaching activities of up to 105 U L(-1) within 24 h (measured with veratryl alcohol as substrate). The cell-free expressed enzyme (cfAaeUPO) was successfully tested in a substrate screening that included prototypical UPO substrates, as well as several pharmaceuticals. The determined activities and catalytic performance were comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (wtAaeUPO). The results presented here suggest that cell-free expression could become a valuable tool to gain easier access to the immense pool of putative UPO genes and to expand the spectrum of these sought-after biocatalysts.","['EC 1.11.2.1', 'cell-free protein synthesis', 'in vitro translation', 'monooxygenase', 'unspecific peroxygenase']","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",Germany,2022 Jan 30
34008589,Flexible online in-droplet cell/synthetic particle concentration utilizing alternating current electrothermal-flow field-effect transistor.,"Cell/particle concentration inside droplets holds great potential in extending lab-in-a-droplet applications, typically ranging from biological and chemical assays. Herein, we present a universal, massive and versatile technique, namely, alternating current electrothermal-flow field-effect transistor (ACET-FFET) to accomplish in-droplet cell/synthetic particle concentration on demand. Three parallel planar electrodes are utilized to generate an artificially reorderable electric field inside droplets by tuning the gate voltage through field-effect control, which results in a reshapable ACET-based microvortices pattern for in-droplet concentration. A downstream Y-shaped junction promotes the mother droplet splitting into two daughter droplets containing highly and poorly concentrated cells/particles, respectively. Fluorescent polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles are used to characterize the variations of ACET-microvortices flow pattern formation within droplets. Moreover, the concentration performance is demonstrated using PS microparticles and Neurospora crassa cells. We show that particles/cells can flexibly accumulate into any daughter droplet or be equally concentrated in both daughter droplets by conveniently regulating the gate voltage. The highly concentrated cells at the entrance of the concentrator show an instantaneous response performance to the external electric field. Further, online simultaneous particle synthesis and concentration inside droplets are proposed and implemented for the first time, demonstrated by efficient in-droplet micromixing and Prussian blue (PB) reaction. The accompanying synthetic PB particles are highly concentrated into either daughter droplet, thereby extending the versatility of the platform. The presented in-droplet concentration strategy, together with its unique features of simple geometric configuration, facile operation and broad applicability can broaden utility in droplet microfluidics.",?,Lab on a chip,PR China 150001. rykhit@hit.edu.cn jhy_hit@hit.edu.cn,2021 May 18
32782023,The role of vegetative cell fusions in the development and asexual reproduction of the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici.,"BACKGROUND: The ability of fungal cells to undergo cell-to-cell communication and anastomosis, the process of vegetative hyphal fusion, allows them to maximize their overall fitness. Previous studies in a number of fungal species have identified the requirement of several signaling pathways for anastomosis, including the so far best characterized soft (So) gene, and the MAPK pathway components MAK-1 and MAK-2 of Neurospora crassa. Despite the observations of hyphal fusions' involvement in pathogenicity and host adhesion, the connection between cell fusion and fungal lifestyles is still unclear. Here, we address the role of anastomosis in fungal development and asexual reproduction in Zymoseptoria tritici, the most important fungal pathogen of wheat in Europe. RESULTS: We show that Z. tritici undergoes self-fusion between distinct cellular structures, and its mechanism is dependent on the initial cell density. Contrary to other fungi, cell fusion in Z. tritici only resulted in cytoplasmic mixing but not in multinucleated cell formation. The deletion of the So orthologous ZtSof1 disrupted cell-to-cell communication affecting both hyphal and germling fusion. We show that Z. tritici mutants for MAPK-encoding ZtSlt2 (orthologous to MAK-1) and ZtFus3 (orthologous to MAK-2) genes also failed to undergo anastomosis, demonstrating the functional conservation of this signaling mechanism across species. Additionally, the DeltaZtSof1 mutant was severely impaired in melanization, suggesting that the So gene function is related to melanization. Finally, we demonstrated that anastomosis is dispensable for pathogenicity, but essential for the pycnidium development, and its absence abolishes the asexual reproduction of Z. tritici. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the role for ZtSof1, ZtSlt2, and ZtFus3 in cell fusions of Z. tritici. Cell fusions are essential for different aspects of the Z. tritici biology, and the ZtSof1 gene is a potential target to control septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease.","['Anastomosis', 'Asexual reproduction', 'Cell-to-cell communication', 'Melanization', 'Vegetative growth']",BMC biology,Switzerland. carolina.sardinha@usys.ethz.ch,2020 Aug 11
29149798,Reconstructing Biosynthetic Pathway of the Plant-Derived Cancer Chemopreventive-Precursor Glucoraphanin in Escherichia coli.,"Epidemiological data confirmed a strong correlation between regular consumption of cruciferous vegetables and lower cancer risk. This cancer preventive property is mainly attributed to the glucosinolate products, such as glucoraphanin found in broccoli that is derived from methionine. Here we report the first successful reconstruction of the complete biosynthetic pathway of glucoraphanin from methionine in Escherichia coli via gene selection, pathway design, and protein engineering. We used branched-chain amino transferase 3 to catalyze two transamination steps to ensure the purity of precursor molecules and used cysteine as a sulfur donor to simplify the synthesis pathway. Two chimeric cytochrome P450 enzymes were engineered and expressed in E. coli functionally. The original plant C-S lyase was replaced by the Neurospora crassa hercynylcysteine sulfoxide lyase. Other pathway enzymes were successfully mined from Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica rapa, and Brassica oleracea. Biosynthesis of glucoraphanin upon coexpression of the optimized enzymes in vivo was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. No other glucosinolate analogues (except for glucoiberin) were identified that could facilitate the downstream purification processes. Production of glucoraphanin in this study laid the foundation for microbial production of such health-beneficial glucosinolates in a large-scale.","['glucoraphanin', 'microbial synthesis', 'pathway engineering', 'protein engineering']",ACS synthetic biology,China,2018 Jan 19

27837988,Short communication: Conversion of lactose and whey into lactic acid by engineered yeast.,"Lactose is often considered an unwanted and wasted byproduct, particularly lactose trapped in acid whey from yogurt production. But using specialized microbial fermentation, the surplus wasted acid whey could be converted into value-added chemicals. The baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is commonly used for industrial fermentation, cannot natively ferment lactose. The present study describes how an engineered S. cerevisiae yeast was constructed to produce lactic acid from purified lactose, whey, or dairy milk. Lactic acid is an excellent proof-of-concept chemical to produce from lactose, because lactic acid has many food, pharmaceutical, and industrial uses, and over 250,000 t are produced for industrial use annually. To ferment the milk sugar lactose, a cellodextrin transporter (CDT-1, which also transports lactose) and a beta-glucosidase (GH1-1, which also acts as a beta-galactosidase) from Neurospora crassa were expressed in a S. cerevisiae strain. A heterologous lactate dehydrogenase (encoded by ldhA) from the fungus Rhizopus oryzae was integrated into the CDT-1/GH1-1-expressing strain of S. cerevisiae. As a result, the engineered strain was able to produce lactic acid from purified lactose, whey, and store-bought milk. A lactic acid yield of 0.358g/g of lactose was achieved from whey fermentation, providing an initial proof of concept for the production of value-added chemicals from excess industrial whey using engineered yeast.","['lactic acid', 'lactose', 'whey', 'yeast']",Journal of dairy science,Urbana 61801,2017 Jan
27303716,"RbdB, a Rhomboid Protease Critical for SREBP Activation and Virulence in Aspergillus fumigatus.","SREBP transcription factors play a critical role in fungal virulence; however, the mechanisms of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) activation in pathogenic fungi remains ill-defined. Screening of the Neurospora crassa whole-genome deletion collection for genes involved in hypoxia responses identified a gene for an uncharacterized rhomboid protease homolog, rbdB, required for growth under hypoxic conditions. Loss of rbdB in Aspergillus fumigatus also inhibited growth under hypoxic conditions. In addition, the A. fumigatus DeltarbdB strain also displayed phenotypes consistent with defective SREBP activity, including increased azole drug susceptibility, reduced siderophore production, and full loss of virulence. Expression of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA binding domain of the SREBP SrbA in DeltarbdB restored all of the phenotypes linking RdbB activity with SrbA function. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of SrbA containing the bHLH DNA binding region was absent from DeltarbdB under inducing conditions, suggesting that RbdB regulates the protein levels of this important transcription factor. As SrbA controls clinically relevant aspects of fungal pathobiology in A. fumigatus, understanding the mechanisms of SrbA activation provides opportunities to target this pathway for therapeutic development. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus fumigatus causes life-threatening infections, and treatment options remain limited. Thus, there is an urgent need to find new therapeutic targets to treat this deadly disease. Previously, we have shown that SREBP transcription factors and their regulatory components are critical for the pathobiology of A. fumigatus. Here we identify a role for RbdB, a rhomboid protease, as an essential component of SREBP activity. Our results indicate that mutants lacking rbdB have growth defects under hypoxic conditions, are hypersusceptible to voriconazole, lack extracellular siderophore production, and fail to cause disease in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This study increases our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in SREBP activation in pathogenic fungi and provides a novel therapeutic target for future development.","['Aspergillus fumigatus', 'antifungal agents', 'fungal pathogenesis', 'fungal virulence', 'hypoxia', 'sterol regulatory element binding protein']",mSphere,USA,2016 Mar-Apr
26932186,The interaction of fungi with the environment orchestrated by RNAi.,"The fungal kingdom has been key in the investigation of the biogenesis and function of small RNAs (sRNAs). The discovery of phenomena such as quelling in Neurospora crassa represents pioneering work in the identification of the main elements of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. Recent discoveries in the regulatory mechanisms in some yeast and filamentous fungi are helping us reach a deeper understanding of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene-silencing mechanisms involved in genome protection against viral infections, DNA damage and transposon activity. Although most of these mechanisms are reasonably well understood, their role in the physiology, response to the environment and interaction of fungi with other organisms had remained elusive. Nevertheless, studies in fungi such as Mucor circinelloides, Magnaporthe oryzae, Cryptococcus neoformans, Trichoderma atroviride, Botrytis cinerea and others have started to shed light on the relevance of the RNAi pathway. In these fungi gene regulation by RNAi is important for growth, reproduction, control of viral infections and transposon activity, as well as in the development of antibiotic resistance and interactions with their hosts. Moreover, the increasing number of reports of the discovery of microRNA-like RNAs in fungi under different conditions highlights the importance of fungi as models for understanding adaptation to the environment using regulation by sRNAs. The goal of this review is to provide the reader with an up-to-date overview of the importance of RNAi in the interaction of fungi with their environment.","['argonaute', 'dicer', 'gene expression', 'microRNA', 'small RNA']",Mycologia,Mexico,2016 May-Jun
34733303,"eIF3k Domain-Containing Protein Regulates Conidiogenesis, Appressorium Turgor, Virulence, Stress Tolerance, and Physiological and Pathogenic Development of Magnaporthe oryzae Oryzae.","The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex consists of essential and non-essential sub-complexes. Non-essential eIF3 complex subunits, such as eIF3e, eIF3j, eIF3k, and eIF3l, modulate stress tolerance and enhance the lifespan of Neurospora crassa and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, there is limited knowledge of the role of the non-essential eIF3 sub-complex in the pathophysiological development of plant fungal pathogens. Here, we deployed genetic and biochemical techniques to explore the influence of a hypothetical protein containing eIF3k domain in Magnaporthe oryzae Oryzae (MoOeIF3k) on reproduction, hyphae morphogenesis, stress tolerance, and pathogenesis. Also, the targeted disruption of MoOeIF3k suppressed vegetative growth and asexual sporulation in DeltaMoOeif3k strains significantly. We demonstrated that MoOeIF3k promotes the initiation and development of the rice blast disease by positively regulating the mobilization and degradation of glycogen, appressorium integrity, host penetration, and colonization during host-pathogen interaction. For the first time, we demonstrated that the eIF3k subunit supports the survival of the blast fungus by suppressing vegetative growth and possibly regulating the conversions and utilization of stored cellular energy reserves under starvation conditions. We also observed that the deletion of MoOeIF3k accelerated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) generation in the DeltaMoOeif3k strains with a corresponding increase in total protein output. In summary, this study unravels the pathophysiological significance of eIF3k filamentous fungi. The findings also underscored the need to systematically evaluate the individual subunits of the non-essential eIF3 sub-complex during host-pathogen interaction. Further studies are required to unravel the influence of synergetic coordination between translation and transcriptional regulatory machinery on the pathogenesis of filamentous fungi pathogens.","['Magnaporthe oryzae Oryzae', 'appressorium', 'non-essential eIF3 complex', 'nutrition starvation', 'ribosomal RNA (rRNA)']",Frontiers in plant science,China,2021

The functional properties and structure characteristics of soybean soluble polysaccharide before and after modification were compared. Results revealed that after fermentation treatment, the content of soybean soluble polysaccharide increased to 7.09%, which was 3.16 times that of raw materials, and the microwave treatment was further increased to 7.69%. The glucose adsorption capacity, glucose dialysis retardation index and the alpha-amylase activity inhibition ration of soybean soluble polysaccharides increased significantly, promotes intestinal flora growth in vitro after fermentation of mixed bacteria and microwave treatment. At the same time, the analysis of monosaccharide composition and structural characteristics showed that the monosaccharide components of soybean soluble polysaccharide were redistributed after modification treatment, Scanning electron microscopy showed that modified soybean soluble polysaccharide has a larger surface area; Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction proved that the modification has slight changes in the functional groups and crystal structure of soybean soluble polysaccharide.

30125294,Functional characterization of a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila.,"Thermophilic fungi are a promising source of thermostable enzymes able to hydrolytically or oxidatively degrade plant cell wall components. Among these enzymes are lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), enzymes capable of enhancing biomass hydrolysis through an oxidative mechanism. Myceliophthora thermophila (synonym Sporotrichum thermophile), an Ascomycete fungus, expresses and secretes over a dozen different LPMOs. In this study, we report the overexpression and biochemical study of a previously uncharacterized LPMO (MtLPMO9J) from M. thermophila M77 in Aspergillus nidulans. MtLPMO9J is a single-domain LPMO and has 63% sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa. Biochemical characterization of MtLPMO9J revealed that it performs C4-oxidation and is active against cellulose, soluble cello-oligosaccharides and xyloglucan. Moreover, biophysical studies showed that MtLPMO9J is structurally stable at pH above 5 and at temperatures up to 50 degrees C. Importantly, LC-MS analysis of the peptides after tryptic digestion of the recombinantly produced protein revealed not only the correct processing of the signal peptide and methylation of the N-terminal histidine, but also partial autoxidation of the catalytic center. This shows that redox conditions need to be controlled, not only during LPMO reactions but also during protein production, to protect LPMOs from oxidative damage.",?,PloS one,Brazil,2018
29931403,Expression of putative circadian clock components in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare.,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are obligatory plant symbionts that live underground, so few studies have examined their response to light. Responses to blue light by other fungi can be mediated by White Collar-1 (WC-1) and WC-2 proteins. These wc genes, together with the frequency gene (frq), also form part of the endogenous circadian clock. The clock mechanism has never been studied in AMF, although circadian growth of their hyphae in the field has been reported. Using both genomic and transcriptomic data, we have found homologs of wc-1, wc-2, and frq and related circadian clock genes in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare (synonym Rhizophagus irregularis). Gene expression of wc-1, wc-2, and frq was analyzed using RT-qPCR on RNA extracted from germinating spores and from fungal material cultivated in vitro with transformed carrot roots. We found that all three core clock genes were expressed in both pre- and post-mycorrhizal stages of R. irregulare growth. Similar to the model fungus Neurospora crassa, the core circadian oscillator gene frq was induced by brief light stimulation. The presence of circadian clock and output genes in R. irregulare opens the door to the study of circadian clocks in the fungal partner of plant-AMF symbiosis. Our finding also provides new insight into the evolution of the circadian frq gene in fungi.","['Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)', 'Circadian clock', 'FRQ gene evolution', 'Light sensing', 'Symbiosis', 'White Collar']",Mycorrhiza,Canada,2018 Aug
29713489,Regulation of plant cell wall degradation by light in Trichoderma.,"Trichoderma reesei (syn. Hypocrea jecorina) is the model organism for industrial production of plant cell wall degradating enzymes. The integration of light and nutrient signals for adaptation of enzyme production in T. reesei emerged as an important regulatory mechanism to be tackled for strain improvement. Gene regulation specific for cellulase inducing conditions is different in light and darkness with substantial regulation by photoreceptors. Genes regulated by light are clustered in the genome, with several of the clusters overlapping with CAZyme clusters. Major cellulase transcription factor genes and at least 75% of glycoside hydrolase encoding genes show the potential of light dependent regulation. Accordingly, light dependent protein complex formation occurs within the promoters of cellulases and their regulators. Additionally growth on diverse carbon sources is different between light and darkness and dependent on the presence of photoreceptors in several cases. Thereby, also light intensity plays a regulatory role, with cellulase levels dropping at higher light intensities dependent in the strain background. The heterotrimeric G-protein pathway is the most important nutrient signaling pathway in the connection with light response and triggers posttranscriptional regulation of cellulase expression. All G-protein alpha subunits impact cellulase regulation in a light dependent manner. The downstream cAMP pathway is involved in light dependent regulation as well. Connections between the regulatory pathways are mainly established via the photoreceptor ENV1. The effect of photoreceptors on plant cell wall degradation also occurs in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. In the currently proposed model, T. reesei senses the presence of plant biomass in its environment by detection of building blocks of cellulose and hemicellulose. Interpretation of the respective signals is subsequently adjusted to the requirements in light and darkness (or on the surface versus within the substrate) by an interconnection of nutrient signaling with light response. This review provides an overview on the importance of light, photoreceptors and related signaling pathways for formation of plant cell wall degrading enzymes in T. reesei. Additionally, the relevance of light dependent gene regulation for industrial fermentations with Trichoderma as well as strategies for exploitation of the observed effects are discussed.","['CAZymes', 'Carbon source utilization', 'EMSA', 'Genomic clusters', 'Hypocrea jecorina', 'Light response', 'Signal transduction', 'Surface sensing', 'Trichoderma reesei']",Fungal biology and biotechnology,Austria.

24415947,The transcription factor BcLTF1 regulates virulence and light responses in the necrotrophic plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea.,"Botrytis cinerea is the causal agent of gray mold diseases in a range of dicotyledonous plant species. The fungus can reproduce asexually by forming macroconidia for dispersal and sclerotia for survival; the latter also participate in sexual reproduction by bearing the apothecia after fertilization by microconidia. Light induces the differentiation of conidia and apothecia, while sclerotia are exclusively formed in the absence of light. The relevance of light for virulence of the fungus is not obvious, but infections are observed under natural illumination as well as in constant darkness. By a random mutagenesis approach, we identified a novel virulence-related gene encoding a GATA transcription factor (BcLTF1 for light-responsive TF1) with characterized homologues in Aspergillus nidulans (NsdD) and Neurospora crassa (SUB-1). By deletion and over-expression of bcltf1, we confirmed the predicted role of the transcription factor in virulence, and discovered furthermore its functions in regulation of light-dependent differentiation, the equilibrium between production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and secondary metabolism. Microarray analyses revealed 293 light-responsive genes, and that the expression levels of the majority of these genes (66%) are modulated by BcLTF1. In addition, the deletion of bcltf1 affects the expression of 1,539 genes irrespective of the light conditions, including the overexpression of known and so far uncharacterized secondary metabolism-related genes. Increased expression of genes encoding alternative respiration enzymes, such as the alternative oxidase (AOX), suggest a mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of bcltf1. The hypersensitivity of Deltabctlf1 mutants to exogenously applied oxidative stress--even in the absence of light--and the restoration of virulence and growth rates in continuous light by antioxidants, indicate that BcLTF1 is required to cope with oxidative stress that is caused either by exposure to light or arising during host infection.",?,PLoS genetics,Germany,2014 Jan
24391918,Assessing the effects of light on differentiation and virulence of the plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea: characterization of the White Collar Complex.,"Organisms are exposed to a tough environment, where acute daily challenges, like light, can strongly affect several aspects of an individual's physiology, including pathogenesis. While several fungal models have been widely employed to understand the physiological and molecular events associated with light perception, various other agricultural-relevant fungi still remain, in terms of their responsiveness to light, in the dark. The fungus Botrytis cinerea is an aggressive pathogen able to cause disease on a wide range of plant species. Natural B. cinerea isolates exhibit a high degree of diversity in their predominant mode of reproduction. Thus, the majority of naturally occurring strains are known to reproduce asexually via conidia and sclerotia, and sexually via apothecia. Studies from the 1970's reported on specific developmental responses to treatments with near-UV, blue, red and far-red light. To unravel the signaling machinery triggering development--and possibly also connected with virulence--we initiated the functional characterization of the transcription factor/photoreceptor BcWCL1 and its partner BcWCL2, that form the White Collar Complex (WCC) in B. cinerea. Using mutants either abolished in or exhibiting enhanced WCC signaling (overexpression of both bcwcl1 and bcwcl2), we demonstrate that the WCC is an integral part of the mentioned machinery by mediating transcriptional responses to white light and the inhibition of conidiation in response to this stimulus. Furthermore, the WCC is required for coping with excessive light, oxidative stress and also to achieve full virulence. Although several transcriptional responses are abolished in the absence of bcwcl1, the expression of some genes is still light induced and a distinct conidiation pattern in response to daily light oscillations is enhanced, revealing a complex underlying photobiology. Though overlaps with well-studied fungal systems exist, the light-associated machinery of B. cinerea appears more complex than those of Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans.",?,PloS one,Chile,2013
24373411,Fungal gene expression levels do not display a common mode of distribution.,"BACKGROUND: RNA-seq studies in metazoa have revealed a distinct, double-peaked (bimodal) distribution of gene expression independent of species and cell type. However, two studies in filamentous fungi yielded conflicting results, with a bimodal distribution in Pyronema confluens and varying distributions in Sordaria macrospora. To obtain a broader overview of global gene expression distributions in fungi, an additional 60 publicly available RNA-seq data sets from six ascomycetes and one basidiomycete were analyzed with respect to gene expression distributions. RESULTS: Clustering of normalized, log2-transformed gene expression levels for each RNA-seq data set yielded distributions with one to five peaks. When only major peaks comprising at least 15% of all analyzed genes were considered, distributions ranged from one to three major peaks, suggesting that fungal gene expression is not generally bimodal. The number of peaks was not correlated with the phylogenetic position of a species; however, higher filamentous asco- and basidiomycetes showed up to three major peaks, whereas gene expression levels in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe had only one to two major peaks, with one predominant peak containing at least 70% of all expressed genes. In several species, the number of peaks varied even within a single species, e.g. depending on the growth conditions as evidenced in the one to three major peaks in different samples from Neurospora crassa. Earlier studies based on microarray and SAGE data revealed distributions of gene expression level that followed Zipf's law, i.e. log-transformed gene expression levels were inversely proportional to the log-transformed expression rank of a gene. However, analyses of the fungal RNA-seq data sets could not identify any that confirmed to Zipf's law. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal gene expression patterns cannot generally be described by a single type of distribution (bimodal or Zipf's law). One hypothesis to explain this finding might be that gene expression in fungi is highly dynamic, and fine-tuned at the level of transcription not only for individual genes, but also at a global level.",?,BMC research notes,Germany. minou.nowrousian@rub.de,2013 Dec 28
36271009,Investigating lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase-assisted wood cell wall degradation with microsensors.,Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) supports biomass hydrolysis by increasing saccharification efficiency and rate. Recent studies demonstrate that H(2)O(2) rather than O(2) is the cosubstrate of the LPMO-catalyzed depolymerization of polysaccharides. Some studies have questioned the physiological relevance of the H(2)O(2)-based mechanism for plant cell wall degradation. This study reports the localized and time-resolved determination of LPMO activity on poplar wood cell walls by measuring the H(2)O(2) concentration in their vicinity with a piezo-controlled H(2)O(2) microsensor. The investigated Neurospora crassa LPMO binds to the inner cell wall layer and consumes enzymatically generated H(2)O(2). The results point towards a high catalytic efficiency of LPMO at a low H(2)O(2) concentration that auxiliary oxidoreductases in fungal secretomes can easily generate. Measurements with a glucose microbiosensor additionally demonstrate that LPMO promotes cellobiohydrolase activity on wood cell walls and plays a synergistic role in the fungal extracellular catabolism and in industrial biomass degradation.,?,Nature communications,Austria,2022 Oct 21
25416526,The Aspergillus nidulans Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor AN5673/RhaR mediates L-rhamnose utilization and the production of alpha-L-rhamnosidases.,"BACKGROUND: Various plant-derived substrates contain L-rhamnose that can be assimilated by many fungi and its liberation is catalyzed by alpha-L-rhamnosidases. Initial data obtained in our laboratory focussing on two Aspergillus nidulans alpha-L-rhamnosidase genes (rhaA and rhaE) showed alpha-L-rhamnosidase production to be tightly controlled at the level of transcription by the carbon source available. Whilst induction is effected by L-rhamnose, unlike many other glycosyl hydrolase genes repression by glucose and other carbon sources occurs in a manner independent of CreA. To date regulatory genes affecting L-rhamnose utilization and the production of enzymes that yield L-rhamnose as a product have not been identified in A. nidulans. The purpose of the present study is to characterize the corresponding alpha-L-rhamnosidase transactivator. RESULTS: In this study we have identified the rhaR gene in A. nidulans and Neurospora crassa (AN5673, NCU9033) encoding a putative Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA-binding protein. Genetic evidence indicates that its product acts in a positive manner to induce transcription of the A. nidulans L-rhamnose regulon. rhaR-deleted mutants showed reduced ability to induce expression of the alpha-L-rhamnosidase genes rhaA and rhaE and concomitant reduction in alpha-L-rhamnosidase production. The rhaR deletion phenotype also results in a significant reduction in growth on L-rhamnose that correlates with reduced expression of the L-rhamnonate dehydratase catabolic gene lraC (AN5672). Gel mobility shift assays revealed RhaR to be a DNA binding protein recognizing a partially symmetrical CGG-X11-CCG sequence within the rhaA promoter. Expression of rhaR alone is insufficient for induction since its mRNA accumulates even in the absence of L-rhamnose, therefore the presence of both functional RhaR and L-rhamnose are absolutely required. In N. crassa, deletion of rhaR also impairs growth on L-rhamnose. CONCLUSIONS: To define key elements of the L-rhamnose regulatory circuit, we characterized a DNA-binding Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor (RhaR) that regulates L-rhamnose induction of alpha-L-rhamnosidases and the pathway for its catabolism in A. nidulans, thus extending the list of fungal regulators of genes encoding plant cell wall polysaccharide degrading enzymes. These findings can be expected to provide valuable information for modulating alpha-L-rhamnosidase production and L-rhamnose utilization in fungi and could eventually have implications in fungal pathogenesis and pectin biotechnology.",?,Microbial cell factories,Spain. epardo@iata.csic.es,2014 Nov 22
30967462,Red- and Blue-Light Sensing in the Plant Pathogen Alternaria alternata Depends on Phytochrome and the White-Collar Protein LreA.,"The filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata is a common postharvest contaminant of food and feed, and some strains are plant pathogens. Many processes in A. alternata are triggered by light. Interestingly, blue light inhibits sporulation, and red light reverses the effect, suggesting interactions between light-sensing systems. The genome encodes a phytochrome (FphA), a white collar 1 (WC-1) orthologue (LreA), an opsin (NopA), and a cryptochrome (CryA) as putative photoreceptors. Here, we investigated the role of FphA and LreA and the interplay with the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. We created loss-of function mutations for fphA, lreA, and hogA using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Sporulation was reduced in all three mutant strains already in the dark, suggesting functions of the photoreceptors FphA and LreA independent of light perception. Germination of conidia was delayed in red, blue, green, and far-red light. We found that light induction of ccgA (clock-controlled gene in Neurospora crassa and light-induced gene in Aspergillus nidulans) and the catalase gene catA depended on FphA, LreA, and HogA. Light induction of ferA (a putative ferrochelatase gene) and bliC (bli-3, light regulated, unknown function) required LreA and HogA but not FphA. Blue- and green-light stimulation of alternariol formation depended on LreA. A lack of FphA or LreA led to enhanced resistance toward oxidative stress due to the upregulation of catalases and superoxide dismutases. Light activation of FphA resulted in increased phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of HogA. Our results show that germination, sporulation, and secondary metabolism are light regulated in A. alternata with distinct and overlapping roles of blue- and red-light photosensors.IMPORTANCE Light controls many processes in filamentous fungi. The study of light regulation in a number of model organisms revealed an unexpected complexity. Although the molecular components for light sensing appear to be widely conserved in fungal genomes, the regulatory circuits and the sensitivity of certain species toward specific wavelengths seem different. In N. crassa, most light responses are triggered by blue light, whereas in A. nidulans, red light plays a dominant role. In Alternaria alternata, both blue and red light appear to be important. In A. alternata, photoreceptors control morphogenetic pathways, the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species, and the production of secondary metabolites. On the other hand, high-osmolarity sensing required FphA and LreA, indicating a sophisticated cross talk between light and stress signaling.","['blue light', 'filamentous fungi', 'light regulation', 'mycotoxin', 'phytochrome', 'plant pathogen', 'white-collar proteins']",mBio,Germany,2019 Apr 9
31034961,Sensing and transduction of nutritional and chemical signals in filamentous fungi: Impact on cell development and secondary metabolites biosynthesis.,"Filamentous fungi respond to hundreds of nutritional, chemical and environmental signals that affect expression of primary metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. These signals are sensed at the membrane level by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs contain usually seven transmembrane domains, an external amino terminal fragment that interacts with the ligand, and an internal carboxy terminal end interacting with the intracellular G protein. There is a great variety of GPCRs in filamentous fungi involved in sensing of sugars, amino acids, cellulose, cell-wall components, sex pheromones, oxylipins, calcium ions and other ligands. Mechanisms of signal transduction at the membrane level by GPCRs are discussed, including the internalization and compartmentalisation of these sensor proteins. We have identified and analysed the GPCRs in the genome of Penicillium chrysogenum and compared them with GPCRs of several other filamentous fungi. We have found 66 GPCRs classified into 14 classes, depending on the ligand recognized by these proteins, including most previously proposed classes of GPCRs. We have found 66 putative GPCRs, representatives of twelve of the fourteen previously proposed classes of GPCRs, depending on the ligand recognized by these proteins. A staggering fortytwo putative members of the new GPCR class XIV, the so-called Pth11 sensors of cellulosic material as reported for Neurospora crassa and some other fungi, were identified. Several GPCRs sensing sex pheromones, known in yeast and in several fungi, were also identified in P.â€¯chrysogenum, confirming the recent unravelling of the hidden sexual capacity of this species. Other sensing mechanisms do not involve GPCRs, including the two-component systems (HKRR), the HOG signalling system and the PalH mediated pH transduction sensor. GPCR sensor proteins transmit their signals by interacting with intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins, that are well known in several fungi, including P.â€¯chrysogenum. These G proteins are inactive in the GDP containing heterotrimeric state, and become active by nucleotide exchange, allowing the separation of the heterotrimeric protein in active Galpha and Gbetagamma dimer subunits. The conversion of GTP in GDP is mediated by the endogenous GTPase activity of the G proteins. Downstream of the ligand interaction, the activated Galpha protein and also the Gbeta/Ggamma dimer, transduce the signals through at least three different cascades: adenylate cyclase/cAMP, MAPK kinase, and phospholipase C mediated pathways.","['Amino acid sensors', 'Ascomycetes', 'Cell wall components sensing', 'Downstream cascade', 'Filamentous fungi', 'Functional analysis', 'G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)', 'G proteins activation', 'GPCRs classification', 'Heterotrimeric G proteins', 'Nutritional signals', 'Penicillium chrysogenum', 'Protein internalization', 'Secondary metabolites', 'Signal receptors', 'Sugar sensors']",Biotechnology advances,Spain.

28634472,"Antifungal Activity against Filamentous Fungi of Ts1, a Multifunctional Toxin from Tityus serrulatus Scorpion Venom.","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are ubiquitous and multipotent components of the innate immune defense arsenal used by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The search for new AMPs has increased in recent years, due to the growing development of microbial resistance to therapeutical drugs. In this work, we evaluate the effects of Tityus serrulatus venom (Tsv), its fractions and its major toxin Ts1, a beta-neurotoxin, on fungi growth. The fractions were obtained by ion-exchange chromatography of Tsv. The growth inhibition of 11 pathogenic and non-pathogenic filamentous fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. terreus, Neurospora crassa, Penicillium corylophilum, P. ochrochloron, P. verrucosum, P. viridicatum, P. waksmanii, and Talaromyces flavus) was evaluated by quantitative microplate reader assay. Tsv (100 and 500 mug/well, which correspond to 1 and 5 mg/mL, respectively, of total soluble protein) was active in inhibiting growth of A. nidulans, A. terreus, P. corylophilum, and P. verrucosum, especially in the higher concentration used and at the first 30 h. After this period, fungi might have used Tsv components as alternative sources of nutrients, and therefore, increased their growth tax. Only fractions IX, X, XI, XIIA, XIIB (3 and 7.5 mug/well, which correspond to 30 and 75 mug/mL, respectively, of total soluble protein) and Ts1 (1.5, 3, and 6 mug/well, which correspond to 2.18, 4.36, and 8.72 muM, respectively) showed antifungal activity. Ts1 showed to be a non-morphogenic toxin with dose-dependent activity against A. nidulans, inhibiting 100% of fungal growth from 3 mug/well (4.36 muM). The inhibitory effect of Ts1 against A. nidulans growth was accompanied by fungistatic effects and was not amended by 1 mM CaCl(2) or tetrodotoxin (46.98 and 93.96 muM). The structural differences between Ts1 and drosomycin, a potent cysteine-rich antifungal peptide, are discussed here. Our results highlight the antifungal potential of the first cysteine-containing scorpion toxin. Since Ts1 is a multifunctional toxin, we suggest that it could be used as a template in the design of engineered scorpion AMPs and in the search for new mechanisms of action of antifungal drugs.","['Tityus serrulatus', 'antifungal drugs', 'antimicrobial peptides', 'antimycotic', 'cysteine-rich antifungal proteins', 'defensins', 'drosomycin', 'fungi']",Frontiers in microbiology,Brazil,2017
24884360,Molecular evolution and functional characterisation of an ancient phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene (NnPAL1) from Nelumbo nucifera: novel insight into the evolution of the PAL family in angiosperms.,"BACKGROUND: Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; E.C.4.3.1.5) is a key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway in plant development, and it catalyses the deamination of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid, leading to the production of secondary metabolites. This enzyme has been identified in many organisms, ranging from prokaryotes to higher plants. Because Nelumbo nucifera is a basal dicot rich in many secondary metabolites, it is a suitable candidate for research on the phenylpropanoid pathway. RESULTS: Three PAL members, NnPAL1, NnPAL2 and NnPAL3, have been identified in N. nucifera using genome-wide analysis. NnPAL1 contains two introns; however, both NnPAL2 and NnPAL3 have only one intron. Molecular and evolutionary analysis of NnPAL1 confirms that it is an ancient PAL member of the angiosperms and may have a different origin. However, PAL clusters, except NnPAL1, are monophyletic after the split between dicots and monocots. These observations suggest that duplication events remain an important occurrence in the evolution of the PAL gene family. Molecular assays demonstrate that the mRNA of the NnPAL1 gene is 2343 bp in size and encodes a 717 amino acid polypeptide. The optimal pH and temperature of the recombinant NnPAL1 protein are 9.0 and 55 degrees C, respectively. The NnPAL1 protein retains both PAL and weak TAL catalytic activities with Km values of 1.07 mM for L-phenylalanine and 3.43 mM for L-tyrosine, respectively. Cis-elements response to environmental stress are identified and confirmed using real-time PCR for treatments with abscisic acid (ABA), indoleacetic acid (IAA), ultraviolet light, Neurospora crassa (fungi) and drought. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the angiosperm PAL genes are not derived from a single gene in an ancestral angiosperm genome; therefore, there may be another ancestral duplication and vertical inheritance from the gymnosperms. The different evolutionary histories for PAL genes in angiosperms suggest different mechanisms of functional regulation. The expression patterns of NnPAL1 in response to stress may be necessary for the survival of N. nucifera since the Cretaceous Period. The discovery and characterisation of the ancient NnPAL1 help to elucidate PAL evolution in angiosperms.",?,BMC evolutionary biology,People's Republic of China. yiding@whu.edu.cn,2014 May 9
30738898,Solution structure and novel insights into phylogeny and mode of action of the Neosartorya (Aspergillus) fischeri antifungal protein (NFAP).,"Small, cysteine-rich and cationic antifungal proteins from natural sources are promising candidates for the development of novel treatment strategies to prevent and combat infections caused by drug-resistant fungi. However, limited information about their structure and antifungal mechanism hampers their future applications. In the present study, we determined the solution structure, dynamics and associated solvent areas of the Neosartorya (Aspergillus) fischeri antifungal protein NFAP. Genome mining within the genus revealed the presence of orthologous genes in N. fischeri and Neosartorya spathulata, and genes encoding closely related proteins can be found in Penicillium brasiliensis and Penicillium oxalicum. We show that the tertiary structure of these putative proteins can be resolved using the structure of NFAP as reliable template for in silico prediction. Localization studies with fluorescence-labelled protein pointed at an energy-dependent uptake mechanism of NFAP in the sensitive model fungus Neurospora crassa and subsequent cytoplasmic localization coincided with cell-death induction. The presented results contribute to a better understanding of the structure/function relationship of NFAP and related proteins and pave the way towards future antifungal drug development.","['Antifungal mechanism', 'Neosartorya (Aspergillus) fischeri antifungal protein (NFAP)', 'Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)']",International journal of biological macromolecules,Hungary,2019 May 15
29686097,Reactivity of O(2) versus H(2)O(2) with polysaccharide monooxygenases.,"Enzymatic conversion of polysaccharides into lower-molecular-weight, soluble oligosaccharides is dependent on the action of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes. Polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs) use an oxidative mechanism to break the glycosidic bond of polymeric carbohydrates, thereby disrupting the crystalline packing and creating new chain ends for hydrolases to depolymerize and degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides. PMOs contain a mononuclear Cu(II) center that is directly involved in C-H bond hydroxylation. Molecular oxygen was the accepted cosubstrate utilized by this family of enzymes until a recent report indicated reactivity was dependent on H(2)O(2) Reported here is a detailed analysis of PMO reactivity with H(2)O(2) and O(2), in conjunction with high-resolution MS measurements. The cosubstrate utilized by the enzyme is dependent on the assay conditions. PMOs will directly reduce O(2) in the coupled hydroxylation of substrate (monooxygenase activity) and will also utilize H(2)O(2) (peroxygenase activity) produced from the uncoupled reduction of O(2) Both cosubstrates require Cu reduction to Cu(I), but the reaction with H(2)O(2) leads to nonspecific oxidation of the polysaccharide that is consistent with the generation of a hydroxyl radical-based mechanism in Fenton-like chemistry, while the O(2) reaction leads to regioselective substrate oxidation using an enzyme-bound Cu/O(2) reactive intermediate. Moreover, H(2)O(2) does not influence the ability of secretome from Neurospora crassa to degrade Avicel, providing evidence that molecular oxygen is a physiologically relevant cosubstrate for PMOs.","['hydrogen peroxide', 'monooxygenase', 'oxygen']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,CA 94720,2018 May 8
31817728,The Fungal Cell Death Regulator czt-1 Is Allelic to acr-3.,"Fungal infections have far-reaching implications that range from severe human disease to a panoply of disruptive agricultural and ecological effects, making it imperative to identify and understand the molecular pathways governing the response to antifungal compounds. In this context, CZT-1 (cell death-activated zinc cluster transcription factor) functions as a master regulator of cell death and drug susceptibility in Neurospora crassa. Here we provide evidence indicating that czt-1 is allelic to acr-3, a previously described locus that we now found to harbor a point mutation in its coding sequence. This nonsynonymous amino acid substitution in a low complexity region of CZT-1/ACR-3 caused a robust gain-of-function that led to reduced sensitivity to acriflavine and staurosporine, and increased expression of the drug efflux pump abc-3. Thus, accumulating evidence shows that CZT-1 is an important broad regulator of the cellular response to various antifungal compounds that appear to share common molecular targets.","['ABC-3', 'CZT-1', 'acriflavine', 'antimicrobial drug resistance', 'cell death', 'staurosporine']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",Portugal,2019 Dec 6
28386988,A new proteinaceous pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) identified in Ascomycete fungi induces cell death in Solanaceae.,"Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are detected by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which gives rise to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). We characterized a novel fungal PAMP, Cell Death Inducing 1 (RcCDI1), identified in the Rhynchosporium commune transcriptome sampled at an early stage of barley (Hordeum vulgare) infection. The ability of RcCDI1 and its homologues from different fungal species to induce cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana was tested following agroinfiltration or infiltration of recombinant proteins produced by Pichia pastoris. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and transient expression of Phytophthora infestans effectors PiAVR3a and PexRD2 were used to assess the involvement of known components of PTI in N. benthamiana responses to RcCDI1. RcCDI1 was highly upregulated early during barley colonization with R. commune. RcCDI1 and its homologues from different fungal species, including Zymoseptoria tritici, Magnaporthe oryzae and Neurospora crassa, exhibited PAMP activity, inducing cell death in Solanaceae but not in other families of dicots or monocots. RcCDI1-triggered cell death was shown to require N. benthamiana Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-Associated Kinase 1 (NbBAK1), N. benthamiana suppressor of BIR1-1 (NbSOBIR1) and N. benthamiana SGT1 (NbSGT1), but was not suppressed by PiAVR3a or PexRD2. We report the identification of a novel Ascomycete PAMP, RcCDI1, recognized by Solanaceae but not by monocots, which activates cell death through a pathway that is distinct from that triggered by the oomycete PAMP INF1.","['Rhynchosporium commune', 'Ascomycete', 'Solanaceae', 'cell death', 'elicitor', 'fungal', 'pathogen', 'pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)']",The New phytologist,UK,2017 Jun
26934920,Genome-wide A-to-I RNA editing in fungi independent of ADAR enzymes.,"Yeasts and filamentous fungi do not have adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) orthologs and are believed to lack A-to-I RNA editing, which is the most prevalent editing of mRNA in animals. However, during this study with the PUK1(FGRRES_01058) pseudokinase gene important for sexual reproduction in Fusarium graminearum, we found that two tandem stop codons, UA(1831)GUA(1834)G, in its kinase domain were changed to UG(1831)GUG(1834)G by RNA editing in perithecia. To confirm A-to-I editing of PUK1 transcripts, strand-specific RNA-seq data were generated with RNA isolated from conidia, hyphae, and perithecia. PUK1 was almost specifically expressed in perithecia, and 90% of transcripts were edited to UG(1831)GUG(1834)G. Genome-wide analysis identified 26,056 perithecium-specific A-to-I editing sites. Unlike those in animals, 70.5% of A-to-I editing sites inF. graminearum occur in coding regions, and more than two-thirds of them result in amino acid changes, including editing of 69PUK1-like pseudogenes with stop codons in ORFs.PUK1orthologs and other pseudogenes also displayed stage-specific expression and editing in Neurospora crassa and F. verticillioides Furthermore,F. graminearum differs from animals in the sequence preference and structure selectivity of A-to-I editing sites. Whereas A's embedded in RNA stems are targeted by ADARs, RNA editing inF. graminearum preferentially targets A's in hairpin loops, which is similar to the anticodon loop of tRNA targeted by adenosine deaminases acting on tRNA (ADATs). Overall, our results showed that A-to-I RNA editing occurs specifically during sexual reproduction and mainly in the coding regions in filamentous ascomycetes, involving adenosine deamination mechanisms distinct from metazoan ADARs.",?,Genome research,China,2016 Apr
25573187,Hypotonic stress-induced calcium signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves TRP-like transporters on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells respond to hypotonic stress (HTS) by a cytosolic calcium rise, either generated by an influx of calcium from extracellular medium, when calcium is available, or by a release from intracellular stores in scarcity of extracellular calcium. Calcium release from intracellular compartments is peculiarly inhibited by external calcium in a calcineurin-independent and Cch1-, but not Mid1-, driven manner. HTS-induced calcium release is also negatively regulated by the ER protein Cls2 and involves a poorly characterized protein, FLC2/YAL053W gene product, previously proposed to be required for FAD transport in the ER, albeit, due to its molecular features, it was also previously classified as an ion transporter. A computational analysis revealed that this gene and its three homologs in S. cerevisiae, together with previously identified Schizosaccharomyces pombe pkd2 and Neurospora crassa calcium-related spray protein, belong to a fungal branch of TRP-like ion transporters related to human mucolipin and polycystin 2 calcium transporters. Moreover, disruption of FLC2 gene confers severe sensitivity to Calcofluor white and hyper-activation of the cell wall integrity MAPK cascade, suggesting a role in cell wall maintenance as previously suggested for the fission yeast homolog. Perturbation in cytosolic resting calcium concentration and hyper-activation of calcineurin in exponentially growing cells suggest a role for this transporter in calcium homeostasis in yeast.","['Budding yeast', 'Mucolipin like calcium channels', 'Osmotic shock', 'PKD2 like calcium channels', 'Polycystin 2 like calcium channels', 'TRPML', 'TRPP']",Cell calcium,Italy,2015 Feb

Full-length and reduced versions of this PKSIII were successfully cloned and overexpressed in a bacterial host, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Both proteins showed the same activity, suggesting that additional amino acid residues at the C-terminus are probably not required for biochemical functions. We demonstrated by LC-ESI-MS/MS that these two recombinant PKSIII proteins could only produce tri- and tetraketide pyrones and alkylresorcinols using only long fatty acid chain from C8 to C16 acyl-CoAs as starter units, in presence of malonyl-CoA.

Deletion of FpAda1 in F. pseudograminearum resulted in defects in hyphal growth, mycelial branching and conidia formation. Pathogenicity assays showed that virulence of the Deltafpada1 mutant was dramatically decreased on wheat coleoptiles and barley leaves. However, wheat coleoptile inoculation assay showed that Deltafpada1 could penetrate and proliferate in wheat cells. Moreover, the FpAda1 was required for abnormal nuclear morphology in conidia and transcription of FpCdc2 and FpCdc42.

NUC-2/PHO81 and its homologs are one of the most important components in the regulation pathway. In soil-borne phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae, we identified a Neurospora crassa nuc-2 homolog gene VdNUC-2. VdNUC-2 is composed of 1,018 amino acids, and is highly conserved in tested filamentous fungi. Under conditions of Pi-starvation, compared with the wild-type strain and ectopic complementation strains, the VdNUC-2 knocked out mutants exhibited reduced radial growth, decreased production of conidia and microsclerotia, and were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress. The virulence of VdNUC-2 defective mutants was significantly compromised, and that was unable to be restored by exogenous application of extra Pi. Additionally, the deletion mutants of VdNUC-1, a key transcription factor gene positively controlled by VdNUC-2 in the PHO pathway, showed the similar cultural phenotypes as VdNUC-2 mutants when both of them grew in Pi-limited conditions. However, the virulence of VdNUC-1 mutants was comparable to the wild-type strain. These evidences indicated that the virulence reduction in VdNUC-2 mutants is not due to the interruptions in the PHO pathway or the disturbance of Pi-homeostasis in V. dahliae cytoplasm.

The thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus grows well with xylose as a carbon source at elevated temperatures, but its xylose fermentation ability is weak. In this study, a combination of the NADPH-preferring xylose reductase (XR) from Neurospora crassa and the NADP(+)-preferring xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) mutant from Scheffersomyces stipitis (Pichia stipitis) was constructed. The xylose fermentation ability and redox balance of the recombinant strains were improved significantly by over-expression of several downstream genes.

These synthetic switches have become a powerful tool for gene regulation, allowing modulation of customized phenotypes, overcoming the obstacles of chemical inducers, and replacing their use by an inexpensive resource: light. In this work, we implemented FUN-LOV, an optogenetic switch based on the photon-regulated interaction of WC-1 and VVD, two LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) blue-light photoreceptors from the fungus Neurospora crassa When tested in yeast, FUN-LOV yields light-controlled gene expression with exquisite temporal resolution and a broad dynamic range of over 1,300-fold, as measured by a luciferase reporter. We also tested the FUN-LOV switch for heterologous protein expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where Western blot analysis confirmed strong induction upon light stimulation, surpassing by 2.5 times the levels achieved with a classic GAL4/galactose chemical-inducible system. Additionally, we utilized FUN-LOV to control the ability of yeast cells to flocculate. Light-controlled expression of the flocculin-encoding gene FLO1, by the FUN-LOV switch, yielded flocculation in light (FIL), whereas the light-controlled expression of the corepressor TUP1 provided flocculation in darkness (FID). Altogether, the results reveal the potential of the FUN-LOV optogenetic switch to control two biotechnologically relevant phenotypes such as heterologous protein expression and flocculation, paving the road for the engineering of new yeast strains for industrial applications. Importantly, FUN-LOV's ability to accurately manipulate gene expression, with a high temporal dynamic range, can be exploited in the analysis of diverse biological processes in various organisms.IMPORTANCE Optogenetic switches are molecular devices which allow the control of different cellular processes by light, such as gene expression, providing a versatile alternative to chemical inducers.

Through the cloning of full-length ORFs in different strains and the analysis of alternative splicing in developmental stages, FfSpdsSr has only one copy and unique transcript encoding chimeric SPDS-SR in F. filiformis. By an orthologous gene search of SpdsSr in more than 80 fungi, we found that the chimeric SpdsSr exists in basidiomycetes, while the two separate Spds and Sr independently exist in ascomycetes, chytridiomycetes, and oomycetes. Further, the transcript level of FfSpdsSr was investigated in different developmental stages and under some common environmental factors and stresses by RT-qPCR. The results showed that FfSpdsSr mainly up-regulated in the elongation stage and pileus development of F. filiformis, as well as under blue light, high temperature, H(2)O(2), and MeJA treatments. Moreover, a total of 15 sets of RNA-Seq data, including 218 samples of Neurospora crassa, were downloaded from the GEO database and used to analyze the expression correlation of NcSpds and NcSr. The results showed that the separate NcSpds and NcSr shared highly similar co-expression patterns in the samples with different strains and different nutritional and environmental condition treatments. The chimeric SpdsSr in basidiomycetes and the co-expression pattern of the Spds and Sr in N. crassa indicate the special link of spermidine and lysine in fungi, which may play an important role in the growth and development of fruiting body and in response to the multiple environmental factors and abiotic stresses.","['ascomycetes', 'basidiomycetes', 'chimeric gene', 'lysine', 'spermidine']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",China,2023 Mar 14

Neutron protein crystallography which permits direct visualization of protonation states was used to investigate the initial steps of oxygen activation directly following active site copper reduction in Neurospora crassa LPMO9D. Herein, we cryo-trap an activated dioxygen intermediate in a mixture of superoxo and hydroperoxo states, and we identify the conserved second coordination shell residue His157 as the proton donor. Density functional theory calculations indicate that both superoxo and hydroperoxo active site states are stable. The hydroperoxo formed is potentially an early LPMO catalytic reaction intermediate or the first step in the mechanism of hydrogen peroxide formation in the absence of substrate. We observe that the N-terminal amino group of the copper coordinating His1 remains doubly protonated directly following molecular oxygen reduction by copper. Aided by molecular dynamics and mining minima free energy calculations we establish that the conserved second-shell His161 in MtPMO3* displays conformational flexibility in solution and that this flexibility is also observed, though to a lesser extent, in His157 of NcLPMO9D. The imidazolate form of His157 observed in our structure following oxygen intermediate protonation can be attributed to abolished His157 flexibility due steric hindrance in the crystal as well as the solvent-occluded active site environment due to crystal packing. A neutron crystal structure of NcLPMO9D at low pH further supports occlusion of the active site since His157 remains singly protonated even at acidic conditions.",?,Chemical science,North Carolina State University Raleigh NC 27695 USA fmeille@ncsu.edu,2022 Nov 23
33787242,Peripheral Methionine Residues Impact Flavin Photoreduction and Protonation in an Engineered LOV Domain Light Sensor.,"Proton-coupled electron transfer reactions play critical roles in many aspects of sensory phototransduction. In the case of flavoprotein light sensors, reductive quenching of flavin excited states initiates chemical and conformational changes that ultimately transmit light signals to downstream targets. These reactions generally require neighboring aromatic residues and proton-donating side chains for rapid and coordinated electron and proton transfer to flavin. Although photoreduction of flavoproteins can produce either the anionic (ASQ) or neutral semiquinone (NSQ), the factors that favor one over the other are not well understood. Here we employ a biologically active variant of the light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain protein VVD devoid of the adduct-forming Cys residue (VVD-III) to probe the mechanism of flavin photoreduction and protonation. A series of isosteric and conservative residue replacements studied by rate measurements, fluorescence quantum yields, FTIR difference spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that tyrosine residues facilitate charge recombination reactions that limit sustained flavin reduction, whereas methionine residues facilitate radical propagation and quenching and also gate solvent access for flavin protonation. Replacement of a single surface Met residue with Leu favors formation of the ASQ over the NSQ and desensitizes photoreduction to oxidants. In contrast, increasing site hydrophilicity by Gln substitution promotes rapid NSQ formation and weakens the influence of the redox environment. Overall, the photoreactivity of VVD-III can be understood in terms of redundant electron donors, internal hole quenching, and coupled proton transfer reactions that all depend upon protein conformation, dynamics, and solvent penetration.",?,Biochemistry,United States,2021 Apr 20
30474279,"CLR-4, a novel conserved transcription factor for cellulase gene expression in ascomycete fungi.","Fungal degradation of lignocellulosic biomass requires various (hemi-)cellulases and is an important part of the natural carbon cycle. Although induction of cellulases has been described for some saprobic filamentous fungi, the regulation of cellulase transcription is complex and many aspects are still poorly understood. Here, we identified and characterized the novel cellulase regulation factor NcCLR-4 in Neurospora crassa and its ortholog MtCLR-4 in Myceliophthora thermophila. Deletion of CLR-4 resulted in similarly defective cellulolytic enzyme production and activities. Transcriptome analyses of DeltaNcclr-4/DeltaMtclr-4 revealed the down-regulation of genes encoding (hemi-)cellulases and pivotal regulators (clr-1, clr-2 and xyr-1) and key genes in the cAMP signaling pathway such as adenylate cyclase Nccr-1. Intracellular cAMP levels were markedly lower in DeltaNcclr-4/DeltaMtclr-4 than in wild-type during cellulose utilization. In electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting assays, NcCLR-4/MtCLR-4 can directly bound to the promoters of Nccr-1/Mtcr-1 (encoding adenylyl cyclase). EMSAs also demonstrated that NcCLR-4/MtCLR-4 could directly bound to clr-1 (encoding a key cellulase regulator), Mtclr-2 and Mtxyr-1 (encoding biomass deconstruction regulators). These findings about the novel cellulase expression regulators NcCLR-4 and MtCLR-4 enrich our understanding of how cellulose degradation is regulated and provide new targets for engineering fungi to deconstruct plant biomass in biorefineries.",?,Molecular microbiology,China,2019 Feb
26253954,"Optimal codons in Tremella fuciformis end in C/G, a strong difference with known Tremella species.","Tremella fuciformis is a popular edible fungus with fruiting bodies that can be produced in large quantities at low costs, while it is easy to transform and cultivate as yeast. This makes it an attractive potential bioreactor. Enhanced heterologous gene expression through codon optimization would be useful, but until now codon usage preferences in T. fuciformis remain unknown. To precisely determine the preferred codon usage of T. fuciformis we sequenced the genome of strain Tr26 resulting in a 24.2 Mb draft genome with 10,040 predicted genes. 3288 of the derived predicted proteins matched the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databases with 40% or more similarity. Corresponding gene models of this subset were subsequently optimized through repetitive comparison of alternative start codons and selection of best length matching gene models. For experimental confirmation of gene models, 96 random clones from an existing T. fuciformis cDNA library were sequenced, generating 80 complete CDSs. Calculated optimal codons for the 3288 predicted and the 80 cloned CDSs were highly similar, indicating sufficient accuracy of predicted gene models for codon usage analysis. T. fuciformis showed a strong preference for C and then G at the third base pair position of used codons, while average GC content of predicted genes was slightly higher than the total genome sequence average. Most optimal codons ended in C or G except for one, and an increased frequency of C ending codons was observed in genes with higher expression levels. Surprisingly, the preferred codon usage in T. fuciformis strongly differed from T. mesenterica and C. neoformans. Instead, optimal codon usage was similar to more distant related species such as Ustilago maydis and Neurospora crassa. Despite much higher overall sequence homology between T. fuciformis and T. mesenterica, only 7 out of 21 optimal codons were equal, whereas T. fuciformis shared up to 20 out of 21 optimal codons with other species. Clearly, codon usage in Tremella can differ largely and should be estimated for individual species. The precise identification of optimal and high expression related codons is therefore an important step in the development of T. fuciformis as a bioreactor system.","['Genome sequencing', 'Relative frequency of synonymous codons', 'Relative synonymous codon usage', 'cDNA library']",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,China. dengyoujin1980@163.com,2015 Nov
35950750,"Circadian oscillations in Trichoderma atroviride and the role of core clock components in secondary metabolism, development, and mycoparasitism against the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea.","Circadian clocks are important for an individual's fitness, and recent studies have underlined their role in the outcome of biological interactions. However, the relevance of circadian clocks in fungal-fungal interactions remains largely unexplored. We sought to characterize a functional clock in the biocontrol agent Trichoderma atroviride to assess its importance in the mycoparasitic interaction against the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea. Thus, we confirmed the existence of circadian rhythms in T. atroviride, which are temperature-compensated and modulated by environmental cues such as light and temperature. Nevertheless, the presence of such molecular rhythms appears to be highly dependent on the nutritional composition of the media. Complementation of a clock null (Deltafrq) Neurospora crassa strain with the T. atroviride-negative clock component (tafrq) restored core clock function, with the same period observed in the latter fungus, confirming the role of tafrq as a bona fide core clock component. Confrontation assays between wild-type and clock mutant strains of T. atroviride and B. cinerea, in constant light or darkness, revealed an inhibitory effect of light on T. atroviride's mycoparasitic capabilities. Interestingly, when confrontation assays were performed under light/dark cycles, T. atroviride's overgrowth capacity was enhanced when inoculations were at dawn compared to dusk. Deleting the core clock-negative element FRQ in B. cinerea, but not in T. atroviride, was vital for the daily differential phenotype, suggesting that the B. cinerea clock has a more significant influence on the result of this interaction. Additionally, we observed that T. atroviride clock components largely modulate development and secondary metabolism in this fungus, including the rhythmic production of distinct volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Thus, this study provides evidence on how clock components impact diverse aspects of T. atroviride lifestyle and how daily changes modulate fungal interactions and dynamics.","['Botrytis cinerea', 'Trichoderma atroviride', 'cell biology', 'circadian rhythms', 'genetics', 'genomics', 'organismal interactions', 'photobiology']",eLife,Chile,2022 Aug 11
34258014,Fixed-target serial femtosecond crystallography using in cellulo grown microcrystals.,"The crystallization of recombinant proteins in living cells is an exciting new approach in structural biology. Recent success has highlighted the need for fast and efficient diffraction data collection, optimally directly exposing intact crystal-containing cells to the X-ray beam, thus protecting the in cellulo crystals from environmental challenges. Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) at free-electron lasers (XFELs) allows the collection of detectable diffraction even from tiny protein crystals, but requires very fast sample exchange to utilize each XFEL pulse. Here, an efficient approach is presented for high-resolution structure elucidation using serial femtosecond in cellulo diffraction of micometre-sized crystals of the protein HEX-1 from the fungus Neurospora crassa on a fixed target. Employing the fast and highly accurate Roadrunner II translation-stage system allowed efficient raster scanning of the pores of micro-patterned, single-crystalline silicon chips loaded with living, crystal-containing insect cells. Compared with liquid-jet and LCP injection systems, the increased hit rates of up to 30% and reduced background scattering enabled elucidation of the HEX-1 structure. Using diffraction data from only a single chip collected within 12 min at the Linac Coherent Light Source, a 1.8 A resolution structure was obtained with significantly reduced sample consumption compared with previous SFX experiments using liquid-jet injection. This HEX-1 structure is almost superimposable with that previously determined using synchrotron radiation from single HEX-1 crystals grown by sitting-drop vapour diffusion, validating the approach. This study demonstrates that fixed-target SFX using micro-patterned silicon chips is ideally suited for efficient in cellulo diffraction data collection using living, crystal-containing cells, and offers huge potential for the straightforward structure elucidation of proteins that form intracellular crystals at both XFELs and synchrotron sources.","['Roadrunner', 'fixed-target SFX', 'in cellulo crystallography', 'intracellular protein crystals', 'serial femtosecond crystallography', 'silicon chip']",IUCrJ,Germany,2021 Jul 1
27984587,Identification of a Novel L-rhamnose Uptake Transporter in the Filamentous Fungus Aspergillus niger.,"The study of plant biomass utilization by fungi is a research field of great interest due to its many implications in ecology, agriculture and biotechnology. Most of the efforts done to increase the understanding of the use of plant cell walls by fungi have been focused on the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose, and transport and metabolism of their constituent monosaccharides. Pectin is another important constituent of plant cell walls, but has received less attention. In relation to the uptake of pectic building blocks, fungal transporters for the uptake of galacturonic acid recently have been reported in Aspergillus niger and Neurospora crassa. However, not a single L-rhamnose (6-deoxy-L-mannose) transporter has been identified yet in fungi or in other eukaryotic organisms. L-rhamnose is a deoxy-sugar present in plant cell wall pectic polysaccharides (mainly rhamnogalacturonan I and rhamnogalacturonan II), but is also found in diverse plant secondary metabolites (e.g. anthocyanins, flavonoids and triterpenoids), in the green seaweed sulfated polysaccharide ulvan, and in glycan structures from viruses and bacteria. Here, a comparative plasmalemma proteomic analysis was used to identify candidate L-rhamnose transporters in A. niger. Further analysis was focused on protein ID 1119135 (RhtA) (JGI A. niger ATCC 1015 genome database). RhtA was classified as a Family 7 Fucose: H+ Symporter (FHS) within the Major Facilitator Superfamily. Family 7 currently includes exclusively bacterial transporters able to use different sugars. Strong indications for its role in L-rhamnose transport were obtained by functional complementation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY.VW.4000 strain in growth studies with a range of potential substrates. Biochemical analysis using L-[3H(G)]-rhamnose confirmed that RhtA is a L-rhamnose transporter. The RhtA gene is located in tandem with a hypothetical alpha-L-rhamnosidase gene (rhaB). Transcriptional analysis of rhtA and rhaB confirmed that both genes have a coordinated expression, being strongly and specifically induced by L-rhamnose, and controlled by RhaR, a transcriptional regulator involved in the release and catabolism of the methyl-pentose. RhtA is the first eukaryotic L-rhamnose transporter identified and functionally validated to date.",?,PLoS genetics,The Netherlands,2016 Dec
26197036,Efficient production of xylitol from hemicellulosic hydrolysate using engineered Escherichia coli.,"A metabolically engineered Escherichia coli has been constructed for the production of xylitol, one of the top 12 platform chemicals from agricultural sources identified by the US Department of Energy. An optimal plasmid was constructed to express xylose reductase from Neurospora crassa with almost no inclusion bodies at relatively high temperature. The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose phosphotransferase system (ptsG) was disrupted to eliminate catabolite repression and allow simultaneous uptake of glucose and xylose. The native pathway for D-xylose catabolism in E. coli W3110 was blocked by deleting the xylose isomerase (xylA) and xylulose kinase (xylB) genes. The putative pathway for xylitol phosphorylation was also blocked by disrupting the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent fructose phosphotransferase system (ptsF). The xylitol producing recombinant E. coli allowed production of 172.4 g L(-1) xylitol after 110 h of fed-batch cultivation with an average productivity of 1.57 g L(-1) h(-1). The molar yield of xylitol to glucose reached approximately 2.2 (mol xylitol mol(-1) glucose). Furthermore, the recombinant strain also produced about 150 g L(-1) xylitol from hemicellulosic sugars in modified M9 minimal medium and the overall productivity was 1.40 g L(-1) h(-1), representing the highest xylitol concentration and productivity reported to date from hemicellulosic sugars using bacteria. Thus, this engineered E. coli is a candidate for the development of efficient industrial-scale production of xylitol from hemicellulosic hydrolysate.","['Hemicellulosic hydrolysate', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Translation initiation rate', 'Xylitol', 'Xylose reductase', 'mRNA secondary structures']",Metabolic engineering,China.

37066045,AA16 Oxidoreductases Boost Cellulose-Active AA9 Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases from Myceliophthora thermophila.,"Copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) classified in Auxiliary Activity (AA) families are considered indispensable as synergistic partners for cellulolytic enzymes to saccharify recalcitrant lignocellulosic plant biomass. In this study, we characterized two fungal oxidoreductases from the new AA16 family. We found that MtAA16A from Myceliophthora thermophila and AnAA16A from Aspergillus nidulans did not catalyze the oxidative cleavage of oligo- and polysaccharides. Indeed, the MtAA16A crystal structure showed a fairly LPMO-typical histidine brace active site, but the cellulose-acting LPMO-typical flat aromatic surface parallel to the histidine brace region was lacking. Further, we showed that both AA16 proteins are able to oxidize low-molecular-weight reductants to produce H(2)O(2). The oxidase activity of the AA16s substantially boosted cellulose degradation by four AA9 LPMOs from M. thermophila (MtLPMO9s) but not by three AA9 LPMOs from Neurospora crassa (NcLPMO9s). The interplay with MtLPMO9s is explained by the H(2)O(2)-producing capability of the AA16s, which, in the presence of cellulose, allows the MtLPMO9s to optimally drive their peroxygenase activity. Replacement of MtAA16A by glucose oxidase (AnGOX) with the same H(2)O(2)-producing activity could only achieve less than 50% of the boosting effect achieved by MtAA16A, and earlier MtLPMO9B inactivation (6 h) was observed. To explain these results, we hypothesized that the delivery of AA16-produced H(2)O(2) to the MtLPMO9s is facilitated by protein-protein interaction. Our findings provide new insights into the functions of copper-dependent enzymes and contribute to a further understanding of the interplay of oxidative enzymes within fungal systems to degrade lignocellulose.",?,ACS catalysis,The Netherlands,2023 Apr 7
31324450,Multidomain Convergence of Argonaute during RISC Assembly Correlates with the Formation of Internal Water Clusters.,"Despite the relevance of Argonaute proteins in RNA silencing, little is known about the structural steps of small RNA loading to form RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). We report the 1.9 A crystal structure of human Argonaute4 with guide RNA. Comparison with the previously determined apo structure of Neurospora crassa QDE2 revealed that the PIWI domain has two subdomains. Binding of guide RNA fastens the subdomains, thereby rearranging the active-site residues and increasing the affinity for TNRC6 proteins. We also identified two water pockets beneath the nucleic acid-binding channel that appeared to stabilize the mature RISC. Indeed, mutating the water-pocket residues of Argonaute2 and Argonaute4 compromised RISC assembly. Simulations predict that internal water molecules are exchangeable with the bulk solvent but always occupy specific positions at the domain interfaces. These results suggest that after guide RNA-driven conformational changes, water-mediated hydrogen-bonding networks tie together the converged domains to complete the functional RISC structure.","['Argonaute', 'PIWI', 'RNAi', 'TNRC6', 'protein folding', 'small RNA', 'water molecules']",Molecular cell,USA,2019 Aug 22
35351200,A three-gene cluster in Trichoderma reesei reveals a potential role of dmm2 in DNA repair and cellulase production.,"BACKGROUND: The ascomycete Trichoderma reesei is one of the most efficient industrial producers of cellulase. Gene targeting by homologous recombination is a key technique for improving strains and constructing mutants. In T. reesei, tku70 (homologous to human KU70) was deleted to block non-homologous end-joining, which led to 95% of transformants exhibiting homologous recombination. RESULTS: Two genes located in close proximity to tku70 were identified: the ferrochelatase gene hem8 (tre78582, homologous to Aspergillus niger hemH and Cryptococcus neoformans HEM15) and a putative DNA methylation modulator-2 gene dmm2 (tre108087, homologous to Neurospora crassa dmm-2). Genome-wide surveys of 324 sequenced fungal genomes revealed that the homologues of the three genes of interest are encoded in tandem in most Sordariomycetes. The expression of this three-gene cluster is regulated by blue light. The roles of these three genes were analyzed via deletion and complementation tests. The gene hem8 was originally described as a novel and highly distinct auxotrophic marker in T. reesei and we found that the product protein, HEM8, catalyzes the final step in heme biosynthesis from highly photoreactive porphyrins. The lethal phenotype of the hem8 deletion could be overcome by hematin supplementation. We also studied the functions of tku70 and dmm2 in DNA repair using mutagen sensitivity experiments. We found that the Deltatku70 strain showed increased sensitivity to bleomycin, which induces DNA double-strand breaks, and that the Deltadmm2 strain was sensitive to bleomycin, camptothecin (an inhibitor of type I topoisomerases), and hydroxyurea (a deoxynucleotide synthesis inhibitor). The double-mutant Deltatku70&dmm2 showed higher sensitivity to hydroxyurea, camptothecin, and bleomycin than either of the single mutants. Knockout of dmm2 significantly increased cellulase production. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show, for the first time, that ferrochelatase encoded by hem8 catalyzes the final step in heme biosynthesis from highly photoreactive porphyrins and that dmm2 encodes a putative DNA methylation modulator-2 protein related to DNA repair and cellulase expression in T. reesei. Our data provide important insights into the roles of this three-gene cluster in T. reesei and other Sordariomycetes and show that the DNA methylation modulator DMM2 affects cellulase gene expression in T. reesei.","['Cellulase', 'DNA methylation modulator-2', 'Ferrochelatase', 'Hem8', 'Trichoderma reesei', 'dmm2', 'tku70']",Biotechnology for biofuels and bioproducts,China,2022 Mar 29
33733477,Light-induced local gene expression in primary chick cell culture system.,"The ability to manipulate gene expression at a specific region in a tissue or cell culture system is critical for analysis of target gene function. For chick embryos/cells, several gene introduction/induction methods have been established such as those involving retrovirus, electroporation, sonoporation, and lipofection. However, these methods have limitations in the accurate induction of localized gene expression. Here we demonstrate the effective application of a recently developed light-dependent gene expression induction system (LightOn system) using the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid fused with a Gal4 DNA binding domain and p65 activation domain (GAVPO) that alters its activity in response to light stimulus in a primary chicken cell culture system. We show that the gene expression level and induction specificity in this system are strongly dependent on the light irradiation conditions. Especially, the irradiation interval is an important parameter for modulating gene expression; for shorter time intervals, higher induction specificity can be achieved. Further, by adjusting light irradiation conditions, the expression level in primary chicken cells can be regulated in a multiple step manner, in contrast to the binary expression seen for gene disruption or introduction (i.e., null or overexpression). This result indicates that the light-dependent expression control method can be a useful technique in chick models to examine how gene function is affected by gradual changes in gene expression levels. We applied this light induction system to regulate Sox9 expression in cultures of chick limb mesenchyme cells and showed that induced SOX9 protein could modulate expression of downstream genes.","['Sox9', 'limb mesenchyme', 'live imaging', 'optogenetics', 'primary cell culture']","Development, growth & differentiation",Japan,2021 Apr
31454399,Integrative Meta-Assembly Pipeline (IMAP): Chromosome-level genome assembler combining multiple de novo assemblies.,"BACKGROUND: Genomic data have become major resources to understand complex mechanisms at fine-scale temporal and spatial resolution in functional and evolutionary genetic studies, including human diseases, such as cancers. Recently, a large number of whole genomes of evolving populations of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 strain) were sequenced in a time-dependent manner to identify temporal evolutionary patterns. For this type of study, a chromosome-level sequence assembly of the strain or population at time zero is required to compare with the genomes derived later. However, there is no fully automated computational approach in experimental evolution studies to establish the chromosome-level genome assembly using unique features of sequencing data. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we developed a new software pipeline, the integrative meta-assembly pipeline (IMAP), to build chromosome-level genome sequence assemblies by generating and combining multiple initial assemblies using three de novo assemblers from short-read sequencing data. We significantly improved the continuity and accuracy of the genome assembly using a large collection of sequencing data and hybrid assembly approaches. We validated our pipeline by generating chromosome-level assemblies of yeast strains W303 and SK1, and compared our results with assemblies built using long-read sequencing and various assembly evaluation metrics. We also constructed chromosome-level sequence assemblies of S. cerevisiae strain Sigma1278b, and three commonly used fungal strains: Aspergillus nidulans A713, Neurospora crassa 73, and Thielavia terrestris CBS 492.74, for which long-read sequencing data are not yet available. Finally, we examined the effect of IMAP parameters, such as reference and resolution, on the quality of the final assembly of the yeast strains W303 and SK1. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a cost-effective pipeline to generate chromosome-level sequence assemblies using only short-read sequencing data. Our pipeline combines the strengths of reference-guided and meta-assembly approaches. Our pipeline is available online at http://github.com/jkimlab/IMAP including a Docker image, as well as a Perl script, to help users install the IMAP package, including several prerequisite programs.

A series of different GAL4-VVD movements, such as binding, sliding, stalling, and dissociation, was observed. Inter-strand jumping on two double-stranded (ds) DNAs was also observed. Detailed analysis using a long substrate DNA strand containing five GAL4-binding sites revealed that GAL4-VVD randomly moved on the dsDNA using sliding and hopping to rapidly find specific binding sites, and then stalled to the specific sites to form a stable complex formation.

24845789,A global multilocus analysis of the model fungus Neurospora reveals a single recent origin of a novel genetic system.,"The large diversity of mating systems observed in the fungal kingdom underlines the importance of mating system change in fungal evolution. The selfing species Neurospora tetrasperma has evolved a novel method of achieving self-fertility by a mating system referred to as pseudohomothallism. However, little is known about the origin of N. tetrasperma and its relationship to the self-sterile, heterothallic, Neurospora species. In this study, we used a combination of phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary history of N. tetrasperma and its heterothallic relatives. We sequenced 9 unlinked nuclear loci from 106 strains of N. tetrasperma sampled from across the globe, and a sample of 28 heterothallic strains of Neurospora. Our analyses provide strong support for monophyly of N. tetrasperma, but reject the monophyly of N. crassa. We estimate that N. tetrasperma is of a recent origin and that it diverged from the heterothallic species  approximately 1 million years ago. We also extend previous findings on the diversification within the N. tetrasperma clade, with 10 lineages identified. Taken together, these findings indicate that N. tetrasperma is younger than has been previously reported and that a rapid diversification of lineages has occurred within the N. tetrasperma clade.","['Divergence time', 'Fungi', 'Mating systems', 'Neurospora', 'Phylogenetics', 'Population structure']",Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,Sweden.

Proteins of interest fused with SULI are stable upon light illumination but are readily degraded after transfer to dark conditions. SULI shows a high dynamic range and a high tolerance to fusion at different positions of the target protein.

33563819,"Distinct Roles of Two DNA Methyltransferases from Cryphonectria parasitica in Fungal Virulence, Responses to Hypovirus Infection, and Viral Clearance.","Two DNA methyltransferase (DNMTase) genes from Cryphonectria parasitica have been previously identified as CpDmt1 and CpDmt2, which are orthologous to rid and dim-2 of Neurospora crassa, respectively. While global changes in DNA methylation have been associated with fungal sectorization and CpDmt1 but not CpDmt2 has been implicated in the sporadic sectorization, the present study continues to investigate the biological functions of both DNMTase genes. Transcription of both DNMTases is regulated in response to infection with the Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV1-EP713). CpDmt1 is upregulated and CpDmt2 is downregulated by CHV1 infection. Conidium production and response to heat stress are affected only by mutation of CpDmt1, not by CpDmt2 mutation. Significant changes in virulence are observed in opposite directions; i.e., the CpDmt1-null mutant is hypervirulent, while the CpDmt2-null mutant is hypovirulent. Compared to the CHV1-infected wild type, CHV1-transferred single and double mutants show severe growth retardation: the colony size is less than 10% that of the parental virus-free null mutants, and their titers of transferred CHV1 are higher than that of the wild type, implying that no defect in viral replication occurs. However, as cultivation proceeds, spontaneous viral clearance is observed in hypovirus-infected colonies of the null mutants, which has never been reported in this fungus-virus interaction. This study demonstrates that both DNMTases are significant factors in fungal development and virulence. Each fungal DNMTase affects fungal biology in both common and separate ways. In addition, both genes are essential to the antiviral responses, including viral clearance which depends on their mutations.IMPORTANCE Although relatively few in number, studies of DNA methylation have shown that fungal DNA methylation is implicated in development, genome integrity, and genome defense. While fungal DNMTase has been suggested as playing a role in genome defense, studies of the biological function of fungal DNMTase have been very limited. In this study, we have shown distinct biological functions of two DNA methyltransferases from the chestnut blight fungus C. parasitica We have demonstrated that DNMTases are important to fungal development and virulence. In addition, these genes are shown to play an important role in the fungal response to hypoviral CHV1 infection, including severely retarded colonial growth, and in viral clearance, which has never been previously observed in mycovirus infection. These findings provide a better understanding of the biological functions of fungal DNA methyltransferase and a basis for clarifying the epigenetic regulation of fungal virulence, responses to hypovirus infection, and viral clearance.","['Cryphonectria parasitica', 'DNA methyltransferase', 'fungal growth and development', 'hypovirulence', 'viral clearance']",mBio,South Korea,2021 Feb 9
30417308,Characterization and functional analysis of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) in the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora.,"Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are unique second-messenger molecules that impact almost all cellular processes in eukaryotes. In this study, five genes encoding different CaMKs were characterized in the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora. These CaMKs, which were retrieved from the A. oligospora genome according to their orthologs in fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa, were expressed at a low level in vitro during mycelial growth stages. Five deletion mutants corresponding to these CaMKs led to growth defects in different media and increased sensitivity to several environmental stresses, including H(2)O(2), menadione, SDS, and Congo red; they also reduced the ability to produce conidia and traps, thus causing a deficiency in nematicidal ability as well. In addition, the transcriptional levels of several typical sporulation-related genes, such as MedA, VelB, and VeA, were down-regulated in all DeltaCaMK mutants compared with the wild-type (WT) strain. Moreover, these mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to heat shock and ultraviolet-radiation stresses compared with the WT strain. These results suggest that the five CaMKs in A. oligospora are involved in regulating multiple cellular processes, such as growth, environmental stress tolerance, conidiation, trap formation, and virulence.","['Arthrobotrys oligospora', 'Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs)', 'Conidiation', 'Environmental stress tolerance', 'Trap formation', 'Virulence']",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,People's Republic of China,2019 Jan
25002579,The combined structural and kinetic characterization of a bacterial nitronate monooxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 establishes NMO class I and II.,"Nitronate monooxygenase (NMO) oxidizes the mitochondrial toxin propionate 3-nitronate (P3N) to malonate semialdehyde. The enzyme has been previously characterized biochemically in fungi, but no structural information is available. Based on amino acid similarity 4,985 genes are annotated in the GenBank(TM) as NMO. Of these, 4,424 (i.e. 89%) are bacterial genes, including several Pseudomonads that have been shown to use P3N as growth substrate. Here, we have cloned and expressed the gene pa4202 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, purified the resulting protein, and characterized it. The enzyme is active on P3N and other alkyl nitronates, but cannot oxidize nitroalkanes. P3N is the best substrate at pH 7.5 and atmospheric oxygen with k(cat)(app)/K(m)(app) of 12 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), k(cat)(app) of 1300 s(-1), and K(m)(app) of 110 mum. Anerobic reduction of the enzyme with P3N yields a flavosemiquinone, which is formed within 7.5 ms, consistent with this species being a catalytic intermediate. Absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography demonstrate a tightly, non-covalently bound FMN in the active site of the enzyme. Thus, PA4202 is the first NMO identified and characterized in bacteria. The x-ray crystal structure of the enzyme was solved at 1.44 A, showing a TIM barrel-fold. Four motifs in common with the biochemically characterized NMO from Cyberlindnera saturnus are identified in the structure of bacterial NMO, defining Class I NMO, which includes bacterial, fungal, and two animal NMOs. Notably, the only other NMO from Neurospora crassa for which biochemical evidence is available lacks the four motifs, defining Class II NMO.","['3-Nitropropionate', 'Enzyme Catalysis', 'Enzyme Structure', 'Flavoprotein', 'Nitronate Monooxygenase', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Propionate 3-Nitronate', 'Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (P.

35843417,RimO (SrrB) is required for carbon starvation signaling and production of secondary metabolites in Aspergillus nidulans.,"Depending on the prevailing environmental, developmental and nutritional conditions, fungi activate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to produce condition-specific secondary metabolites (SMs). For activation, global chromatin-based de-repression must be integrated with pathway-specific induction signals. Here we describe a new global regulator needed to activate starvation-induced SMs. In our transcriptome dataset, we found locus AN7572 strongly transcribed solely under conditions of starvation-induced SM production. The predicted AN7572 protein is most similar to the stress and nutritional regulator Rim15 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and to STK-12 of Neurospora crassa. Based on this similarity and on stress and nutritional response phenotypes of A. nidulans knock-out and overexpression strains, AN7572 is designated rimO. In relation to SM production, we found that RimO is required for the activation of starvation-induced BGCs, including the sterigmatocystin (ST) gene cluster. Here, RimO regulates the pathway-specific transcription factor AflR both at the transcriptional and post-translational level. At the transcriptional level, RimO mediates aflR induction following carbon starvation and at the post-translational level, RimO is required for nuclear accumulation of the AflR protein. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling showed that cells lacking rimO fail to adapt to carbon starvation that, in the wild type, leads to down-regulation of genes involved in basic metabolism, membrane biogenesis and growth. Consistently, strains overexpressing rimO are more resistant to oxidative and osmotic stress, largely insensitive to glucose repression and strongly overproduce several SMs. Our data indicate that RimO is a positive regulator within the SM and stress response network, but this requires nutrient depletion that triggers both, rimO gene transcription and activation of the RimO protein.","['Aspergillus', 'Rim15', 'Secondary metabolites', 'Starvation response', 'Sterigmatocystin', 'Stress regulation']",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,Austria.

30979837,The Blue-Light Photoreceptor Sfwc-1 Gene Regulates the Phototropic Response and Fruiting-Body Development in the Homothallic Ascomycete Sordaria fimicola.,"Sordaria fimicola, a coprophilous ascomycete, is a homothallic fungus that can undergo sexual differentiation with cellular and morphological changes followed by multicellular tissue development to complete its sexual cycle. In this study, we identified and characterized the blue-light photoreceptor gene in S. fimicola The S. fimicola white collar-1 photoreceptor (SfWC-1) contains light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV), Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS), and other conserved domains and is homologous to the WC-1 blue-light photoreceptor of Neurospora crassa The LOV domain of Sfwc-1 was deleted by homologous recombination using Agrobacterium-mediated protoplast transformation. The Sfwc-1(()(Deltalov)()) mutant showed normal vegetative growth but produced less carotenoid pigment under illumination. The mutant showed delayed and less-pronounced fruiting-body formation, was defective in phototropism of the perithecial beaks, and lacked the fruiting-body zonation pattern compared with the wild type under the illumination condition. Gene expression analyses supported the light-induced functions of the Sfwc-1 gene in the physiology and developmental process of perithecial formation in S. fimicola Moreover, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged SfWC-1 fluorescence signals were transiently strong upon light induction and prominently located inside the nuclei of living hyphae. Our studies focused on the putative blue-light photoreceptor in a model ascomycete and contribute to a better understanding of the photoregulatory functions and networks mediated by the evolutionarily conserved blue-light photoreceptors across diverse fungal phyla.IMPORTANCESordaria sp. has been a model for study of fruiting-body differentiation in fungi.

36135677,Genome-Wide Screening and Stability Verification of the Robust Internal Control Genes for RT-qPCR in Filamentous Fungi.,"In real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), internal control genes (ICGs) are crucial for normalization. This study screened 6 novel ICGs: Pre-mRNA-splicing factor cwc15 (Cwf15); ER associated DnaJ chaperone (DnaJ); E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4 (HUL4); ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (MDR/TAP), member 1 (VAMP); Exosome complex exonuclease DIS3/RRP44 (RNB); V-type H(+)-transporting ATPase sub-unit A (V-ATP) from the 22-transcriptome data of 8 filamentous fungi. The six novel ICGs are all involved in the basic biological process of cells and share the different transcription levels from high to low. In order to further verify the stability of ICGs candidates, the six novel ICGs as well as three traditional housekeeping genes: beta-actin (ACTB); beta-tubulin (beta-TUB); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) and the previously screened reference genes: SPRY-domain-containing protein (SPRYp); Ras-2 protein (Ras); Vacuolar protein sorting protein 26 (Vps26) were evaluated by geNorm and NormFinder statistical algorithms. RT-qPCR of 12 ICGs were performed at different developmental stages in Flammulina filiformis and under different treatment conditions in Neurospora crassa. The consistent results of the two algorithms suggested that the novel genes, RNB, V-ATP, and VAMP, showed the highest stability in F. filiformis and N. crassa. RNB, V-ATP, and VAMP have high expression stability and universal applicability and therefore have great potential as ICGs for standardized calculation in filamentous fungi. The results also provide a novel guidance for the screening stable reference genes in RT-qPCR and a wide application in gene expression analysis of filamentous fungi.","['RT-qPCR', 'filamentous fungi', 'gene expression', 'internal control genes']","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",China,2022 Sep 10
34346745,Inhibition of Aspergillus oryzae Mycelium Growth and Conidium Production by Irradiation with Light at Different Wavelengths and Intensities.,"Aspergillus oryzae is a safe filamentous fungus widely used in the food, medicine, and feed industries, but there is currently not enough research on the light response of A. oryzae. In this study, 12 different light conditions were set and A. oryzae GDMCC 3.31 was continuously irradiated for 72 h to investigate the effect of light on mycelial growth and conidium production. Specifically, each light condition was the combination of one light wavelength (475, 520, or 630 nm) and one light intensity (20, 40, 60, or 80 mumol photon m(-2) s(-1)). The results show that mycelium growth was inhibited significantly by green light (wavelength of 520 nm and intensities of 20 and 60 mumol photon m(-2) s(-1)) and blue light (wavelength of 475 nm and intensity of 80 mumol photon m(-2) s(-1)). The production of conidia was suppressed only by blue light (wavelength of 475 nm and intensities of 40, 60, and 80 mumol photon m(-2) s(-1)), and those levels of inhibition increased when the intensity of blue light increased. When the strain was irradiated by blue light (80 mumol photon m(-2) s(-1)), the number of conidia was 57.4% less than that of the darkness group. However, within our set range of light intensities, A. oryzae GDMCC 3.31 was insensitive to red light (wavelength of 630 nm) in terms of mycelium growth and conidium production. Moreover, interaction effects between light wavelength and intensity were found to exist in terms of colony diameter and the number of conidia. This research investigated the light response of A. oryzae, which may provide a new method to regulate mixed strains in fermented foods by light. IMPORTANCE Studies on the monochromatic light response of Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa have gone deep into the molecular mechanism. However, research methods for the light response of A. oryzae remain in the use of white light sources. In this study, we first demonstrated that A. oryzae GDMCC 3.31 was sensitive to light wavelength and intensity. We have observed that blue light inhibited its growth and sporulation and the inhibitory effect increased with intensity. This research not only adds new content to the study of the photoreaction of Aspergillus but also brings new possibilities for the use of light to regulate mixed strains and ultimately improve the flavor quality of fermented foods.","['Aspergillus oryzae', 'conidium', 'light intensity', 'light wavelength', 'photoreaction']",Microbiology spectrum,China,2021 Sep 3
31254227,"Cloning, Characterization, and Functional Expression of a Thermostable Type B Feruloyl Esterase from Thermophilic Thielavia Terrestris.","Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) have great potential applications in paper and breeding industry. A new thermo-stable feruloyl esterase gene, TtfaeB was identified from the thermophilic fungus Thielavia terrestris h408. Deduced protein sequence shares the identity of 67% with FAEB from Neurospora crassa. The expression vector pPIC9K-TtfaeB was successfully constructed and electro-transformed into GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris. One transformant with high feruloyl esterase yield was obtained through plate screening and named TtFAEB1. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of fermentation supernatant from transformant TtFAEB1 showed a distinct protein band appearing at the position of about 35-kDa, indicating that TtfaeB gene has been successfully expressed in P. pastoris. The recombinant TtFAEB was purified by affinity chromatography and the specific activity of purified TtFAEB was 6.06 +/- 0.72 U/mg. The optimal temperature and pH for purified recombinant TtFAEB was 60  degrees C and 7.0, respectively. TtFAEB was thermostable, retaining 96.89 and 84.16% of the maximum activity after being treated for 1 h at 50  degrees C and 60  degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the enzyme was stable in the pH range 4.5-8.0. The homology model of TtFAEB showed that it consists of a single domain adopting a typical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and contains a catalytic triad formed by Ser117, Asp201, and His260. TtFAEB in association with xylanase from Trichoderma reesei could release 77.1% of FA from destarched wheat bran. The present results indicated that the recombinant TtFAEB with excellent enzymatic properties is a promising candidate for potential applications in biomass deconstruction and biorefinery.","['Feruloyl esterase', 'Heterologous expression', 'Thermostable', 'Thielavia terrestris']",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,P.

31277660,Construction of Escherichia coli cell factories for crocin biosynthesis.,"BACKGROUND: Crocin is a carotenoid-derived natural product found in the stigma of Crocus spp., which has great potential in medicine, food and cosmetics. In recent years, microbial production of crocin has drawn increasing attention, but there were no reports of successful implementation. Escherichia coli has been engineered to produce various carotenoids, including lycopene, beta-carotene and astaxanthin. Therefore, we intended to construct E. coli cell factories for crocin biosynthesis. RESULTS: In this study, a heterologous crocetin and crocin synthesis pathway was first constructed in E. coli. Firstly, the three different zeaxanthin-cleaving dioxygenases CsZCD, CsCCD2 from Crocus sativus, and CaCCD2 from Crocus ancyrensis, as well as the glycosyltransferases UGT94E5 and UGT75L6 from Gardenia jasminoides, were introduced into zeaxanthin-producing E. coli cells. The results showed that CsCCD2 catalyzed the synthesis of crocetin dialdehyde. Next, the aldehyde dehydrogenases ALD3, ALD6 and ALD9 from Crocus sativus and ALD8 from Neurospora crassa were tested for crocetin dialdehyde oxidation, and we were able to produce 4.42 mg/L crocetin using strain YL4(pCsCCD2-UGT94E5-UGT75L6,pTrc-ALD8). Glycosyltransferases from diverse sources were screened by in vitro enzyme activity assays. The results showed that crocin and its various derivatives could be obtained using the glycosyltransferases YjiC, YdhE and YojK from Bacillus subtilis, and the corresponding genes were introduced into the previously constructed crocetin-producing strain. Finally, crocin-5 was detected among the fermentation products of strain YL4(pCsCCD2-UGT94E5-UGT75L6,pTrc-ALD8,pET28a-YjiC-YdhE-YojK) using HPLC and LC-ESI-MS. CONCLUSIONS: A heterologous crocin synthesis pathway was constructed in vitro, using glycosyltransferases from the Bacillus subtilis instead of the original plant glycosyltransferases, and a crocetin and crocin-5 producing E. coli cell factory was obtained. This research provides a foundation for the large-scale production of crocetin and crocin in E. coli cell factories.","['Crocetin', 'Crocin', 'Escherichia coli', 'Glycosyltransferase', 'Saffron stigma']",Microbial cell factories,People's Republic of China,2019 Jul 5
25342722,Intron evolution in Neurospora: the role of mutational bias and selection.,"We used comparative and population genomics to study intron evolutionary dynamics in the fungal model genus Neurospora. For our investigation, we used well-annotated genomes of N. crassa, N. discreta, and N. tetrasperma, and 92 resequenced genomes of N. tetrasperma from natural populations. By analyzing the four well-annotated genomes, we identified 9495 intron sites in 7619 orthologous genes. Our data supports nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and tandem duplication as mechanisms for intron gains in the genus and the RT-mRNA process as a mechanism for intron loss. We found a moderate intron gain rate (5.78-6.89 x 10(-13) intron gains per nucleotide site per year) and a high intron loss rate (7.53-13.76 x 10(-10) intron losses per intron sites per year) as compared to other eukaryotes. The derived intron gains and losses are skewed to high frequencies, relative to neutral SNPs, in natural populations of N. tetrasperma, suggesting that selection is involved in maintaining a high intron turnover. Furthermore, our analyses of the association between intron population-level frequency and genomic features suggest that selection is involved in shaping a 5' intron position bias and a low intron GC content. However, intron sequence analyses suggest that the gained introns were not exposed to recent selective sweeps. Taken together, this work contributes to our understanding of the importance of mutational bias and selection in shaping the intron distribution in eukaryotic genomes.",?,Genome research,Sweden,2015 Jan
32188455,"Assessment of the ptxD gene as a growth and selective marker in Trichoderma atroviride using Pccg6, a novel constitutive promoter.","BACKGROUND: Trichoderma species are among the most effective cell factories to produce recombinant proteins, whose productivity relies on the molecular toolkit and promoters available for the expression of the target protein. Although inducible promoter systems have been developed for producing recombinant proteins in Trichoderma, constitutive promoters are often a desirable alternative. Constitutive promoters are simple to use, do not require external stimuli or chemical inducers to be activated, and lead to purer enzyme preparations. Moreover, most of the promoters for homologous and heterologous expression reported in Trichoderma have been commonly evaluated by directly assessing production of industrial enzymes, requiring optimization of laborious protocols. RESULTS: Here we report the identification of Pccg6, a novel Trichoderma atroviride constitutive promoter, that has similar transcriptional strength as that of the commonly used pki1 promoter. Pccg6 displayed conserved arrangements of transcription factor binding sites between promoter sequences of Trichoderma ccg6 orthologues genes, potentially involved in their regulatory properties. The predicted ccg6-encoded protein potentially belongs to the SPE1/SPI1 protein family and shares high identity with CCG6 orthologue sequences from other fungal species including Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma virens, Trichoderma asperellum, and to a lesser extent to that of Neurospora crassa. We also report the use of the Pccg6 promoter to drive the expression of PTXD, a phosphite oxidoreductase of bacterial origin, which allowed T. atroviride to utilize phosphite as a sole source of phosphorus. We propose ptxD as a growth reporter gene that allows real-time comparison of the functionality of different promoters by monitoring growth of Trichoderma transgenic lines and enzymatic activity of PTXD. Finally, we show that constitutive expression of ptxD provided T. atroviride a competitive advantage to outgrow bacterial contaminants when supplied with phosphite as a sole source of phosphorus. CONCLUSIONS: A new constitutive promoter, ccg6, for expression of homologous and heterologous proteins has been identified and tested in T. atroviride to express PTXD, which resulted in an effective and visible phenotype to evaluate transcriptional activity of sequence promoters. Use of PTXD as a growth marker holds great potential for assessing activity of other promoters and for biotechnological applications as a contamination control system.","['Contamination control', 'Growth marker', 'Phosphite', 'Phosphite oxidoreductase (PTXD)', 'ccg6 promoter']",Microbial cell factories,Mexico,2020 Mar 18
32033952,Blakeslea trispora Photoreceptors: Identification and Functional Analysis.,"Blakeslea trispora is an industrial fungal species used for large-scale production of carotenoids. However, B. trispora light-regulated physiological processes, such as carotenoid biosynthesis and phototropism, are not fully understood. In this study, we isolated and characterized three photoreceptor genes, btwc-1a, btwc-1b, and btwc-1c, in B. trispora Bioinformatics analyses of these genes and their protein sequences revealed that the functional domains (PAS/LOV [Per-ARNT-Sim/light-oxygen-voltage] domain and zinc finger structure) of the proteins have significant homology to those of other fungal blue-light regulator proteins expressed by Mucor circinelloides and Neurospora crassa The photoreceptor proteins were synthesized by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli The chromogenic groups consisting of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) were detected to accompany BTWC-1 proteins by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence spectrometry, demonstrating that the proteins may be photosensitive. The absorbance changes of the purified BTWC-1 proteins seen under dark and light conditions indicated that they were light responsive and underwent a characteristic photocycle by light induction. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteine residual (Cys) in BTWC-1 did not affect the normal expression of the protein in E. coli but did lead to the loss of photocycle response, indicating that Cys represents a flavin-binding domain for photon detection. We then analyzed the functions of BTWC-1 proteins by complementing btwc-1a, btwc-1b, and btwc-1c into the counterpart knockout strains of M. circinelloides for each mcwc-1 gene. Transformation of the btwc-1a complement into mcwc-1a knockout strains restored the positive phototropism, while the addition of btwc-1c complement remedied the deficiency of carotene biosynthesis in the mcwc-1c knockout strains under conditions of illumination. These results indicate that btwc-1a and btwc-1c are involved in phototropism and light-inducible carotenogenesis. Thus, btwc-1 genes share a conserved flavin-binding domain and act as photoreceptors for control of different light transduction pathways in B. trisporaIMPORTANCE Studies have confirmed that light-regulated carotenogenesis is prevalent in filamentous fungi, especially in mucorales. However, few investigations have been done to understand photoinduced synthesis of carotenoids and related mechanisms in B. trispora, a well-known industrial microbial strains. In the present study, three photoreceptor genes in B. trispora were cloned, expressed, and characterized by bioinformatics and photoreception analyses, and then in vivo functional analyses of these genes were constructed in M. circinelloides The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of photoreception and light-regulated carotenoid synthesis and other physiological responses in B. trispora.","['Blakeslea trispora', 'btwc-1', 'light-regulated processes', 'photoreceptors']",Applied and environmental microbiology,People's Republic of China wluo@jiangnan.edu.cn raozhm@jiangnan.edu.cn,2020 Apr 1

The objective was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of the substrate (1) and its metabolites. This yielded seven new metabolites, 14alpha-hydroxy-6alpha-methylpregn-4-ene-3,11,20-trione (2), 6beta-hydroxy-6alpha-methylpregn-4-ene-3,11,20-trione (3), 15beta-hydroxy-6alpha-methylpregn-4-ene-3,11,20-trione (4), 6beta,17alpha-dihydroxy-6alpha-methylpregn-4-ene-3,11,20-trione (5), 6beta,20S-dihydroxy-6alpha-methylpregn-4-ene-3,11-dione (6), 11beta,16beta-dihydroxy-6alpha-methylpregn-4-ene-3,11-dione (7), and 15beta,20R-dihydroxy-6alpha-methylpregn-4-ene-3,11-dione (8).

28912831,Genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of Trichoderma reesei QM9978 strain reveals a distal chromosome translocation to be responsible for loss of vib1 expression and loss of cellulase induction.,"BACKGROUND: The hydrolysis of biomass to simple sugars used for the production of biofuels in biorefineries requires the action of cellulolytic enzyme mixtures. During the last 50 years, the ascomycete Trichoderma reesei, the main source of industrial cellulase and hemicellulase cocktails, has been subjected to several rounds of classical mutagenesis with the aim to obtain higher production levels. During these random genetic events, strains unable to produce cellulases were generated. Here, whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic analyses of the cellulase-negative strain QM9978 were used for the identification of mutations underlying this cellulase-negative phenotype. RESULTS: Sequence comparison of the cellulase-negative strain QM9978 to the reference strain QM6a identified a total of 43 mutations, of which 33 were located either close to or in coding regions. From those, we identified 23 single-nucleotide variants, nine InDels, and one translocation. The translocation occurred between chromosomes V and VII, is located upstream of the putative transcription factor vib1, and abolishes its expression in QM9978 as detected during the transcriptomic analyses. Ectopic expression of vib1 under the control of its native promoter as well as overexpression of vib1 under the control of a strong constitutive promoter restored cellulase expression in QM9978, thus confirming that the translocation event is the reason for the cellulase-negative phenotype. Gene deletion of vib1 in the moderate producer strain QM9414 and in the high producer strain Rut-C30 reduced cellulase expression in both cases. Overexpression of vib1 in QM9414 and Rut-C30 had no effect on cellulase production, most likely because vib1 is already expressed at an optimal level under normal conditions. CONCLUSION: We were able to establish a link between a chromosomal translocation in QM9978 and the cellulase-negative phenotype of the strain. We identified the transcription factor vib1 as a key regulator of cellulases in T. reesei whose expression is absent in QM9978. We propose that in T. reesei, as in Neurospora crassa, vib1 is involved in cellulase induction, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The data presented here show an example of a combined genome sequencing and transcriptomic approach to explain a specific trait, in this case the QM9978 cellulase-negative phenotype, and how it helps to better understand the mechanisms during cellulase gene regulation. When focusing on mutations on the single base-pair level, changes on the chromosome level can be easily overlooked and through this work we provide an example that stresses the importance of the big picture of the genomic landscape during analysis of sequencing data.","['Cellulase production', 'Genome analysis', 'Promoter', 'Transcriptome', 'Translocation', 'Trichoderma reesei', 'vib1']",Biotechnology for biofuels,France.

32845601,Pristine and Antibiotic-Loaded Nanosheets/Nanoneedles-Based Boron Nitride Films as a Promising Platform to Suppress Bacterial and Fungal Infections.,"In recent years, bacteria inactivation during their direct physical contact with surface nanotopography has become one of the promising strategies for fighting infection. Contact-killing ability has been reported for several nanostructured surfaces, e.g., black silicon, carbon nanotubes, zinc oxide nanorods, and copper oxide nanosheets. Herein, we demonstrate that Gram-negative antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria are killed as a result of their physical destruction while contacting nanostructured h-BN surfaces. BN films, made of spherical nanoparticles formed by numerous nanosheets and nanoneedles with a thickness <15 nm, have been obtained through a reaction of ammonia with amorphous boron. The contact-killing bactericidal effect of BN nanostructures has been compared with a toxic effect of gentamicin released from them. For a wider protection against bacterial and fungal infection, the films have been saturated with a mixture of gentamicin and amphotericin B. Such BN films demonstrate a high antibiotic/antimycotic agent loading capacity and a fast initial and sustained release of therapeutic agents for 170-260 h depending on the loaded dose. The pristine BN films possess high antibacterial activity against E. coli K-261 strain at their initial concentration of 10(4) cells/mL, attaining >99% inactivation of colony forming units after 24 h, same as gentamicin-loaded (150 mug/cm(2)) BN sample. The BN films loaded with a mixture of gentamicin (150 and 300 mug/cm(2)) and amphotericin B (100 mug/cm(2)) effectively inhibit the growth of E. coli K-261 and Neurospora crassa strains. During immersion in the normal saline solution, the BN film generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to accelerated oxidative stress at the site of physical cell damage. The obtained results are valuable for further development of nanostructured surfaces having contact killing, ROS, and biocide release abilities.","['antibacterial activity', 'antibiotic-loaded surfaces', 'antifungal activity', 'drug release', 'nanostructured BN-based films']",ACS applied materials & interfaces,Russia,2020 Sep 23
29844227,Candidate Enzymes for Saffron Crocin Biosynthesis Are Localized in Multiple Cellular Compartments.,"Saffron is the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus and is the most expensive spice in the world. Its red color is due to crocins, which are apocarotenoid glycosides that accumulate in the vacuole to a level up to 10% of the stigma dry weight. Previously, we characterized the first dedicated enzyme in the crocin biosynthetic pathway, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase2 (CsCCD2), which cleaves zeaxanthin to yield crocetin dialdehyde. In this work, we identified six putative aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes expressed in C. sativus stigmas. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli showed that only one of corresponding proteins (CsALDH3I1) was able to convert crocetin dialdehyde into the crocin precursor crocetin. CsALDH3I1 carries a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain, similar to that of the Neurospora crassa membrane-associated apocarotenoid dehydrogenase YLO-1. We also characterized the UDP-glycosyltransferase CsUGT74AD1, which converts crocetin to crocins 1 and 2'. In vitro assays revealed high specificity of CsALDH3I1 for crocetin dialdehyde and long-chain apocarotenals and of CsUGT74AD1 for crocetin. Following extract fractionation, CsCCD2, CsALDH3I1, and CsUGT74AD1 were found in the insoluble fraction, suggesting their association with membranes or large insoluble complexes. Analysis of protein localization in both C. sativus stigmas and following transgene expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves revealed that CsCCD2, CsALDH3I, and CsUGT74AD1 were localized to the plastids, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cytoplasm, respectively, in association with cytoskeleton-like structures. Based on these findings and current literature, we propose that the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm function as transit centers for metabolites whose biosynthesis starts in the plastid and are accumulated in the vacuole.",?,Plant physiology,Italy,2018 Jul
37083494,The nutrient-sensing GCN2 signaling pathway is essential for circadian clock function by regulating histone acetylation under amino acid starvation.,"Circadian clocks are evolved to adapt to the daily environmental changes under different conditions. The ability to maintain circadian clock functions in response to various stresses and perturbations is important for organismal fitness. Here, we show that the nutrient-sensing GCN2 signaling pathway is required for robust circadian clock function under amino acid starvation in Neurospora. The deletion of GCN2 pathway components disrupts rhythmic transcription of clock gene frq by suppressing WC complex binding at the frq promoter due to its reduced histone H3 acetylation levels. Under amino acid starvation, the activation of GCN2 kinase and its downstream transcription factor CPC-1 establish a proper chromatin state at the frq promoter by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase GCN-5. The arrhythmic phenotype of the GCN2 kinase mutants under amino acid starvation can be rescued by inhibiting histone deacetylation. Finally, genome-wide transcriptional analysis indicates that the GCN2 signaling pathway maintains robust rhythmic expression of metabolic genes under amino acid starvation. Together, these results uncover an essential role of the GCN2 signaling pathway in maintaining the robust circadian clock function in response to amino acid starvation, and demonstrate the importance of histone acetylation at the frq locus in rhythmic gene expression.","['N. crassa', 'cell biology', 'genetics', 'genomics']",eLife,China,2023 Apr 21
29772356,Assessment of toxicity and differential antimicrobial activity of methanol extract of rhizome of Simaba ferruginea A. St.-Hil. and its isolate canthin-6-one.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Simaba ferruginea A. St.-Hil., Simaroubaceae, popularly known as ""calunga"" is a typical subtropical shrub used in Central Brazil mainly for infection, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and gastric duodenal-ulcers. It presents in its composition the alkaloid canthin-6-one, an alkaloid indole beta-carboxylic. AIM: This study aims to investigate the toxicity, antimicrobial activities of methanol extract of Simaba ferruginea (MESf) and canthin-6-one by using different experimental models. METHODS: The present study evaluated the phytochemical analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), toxicological potential of MESf and canthin-6-one, using the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity assays with CHO-K1 cells and in vivo acute test in mice. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the broth microdilution assays, while the antimicrobial mechanism of action was also assessed using different in vitro bacterial and fungal models. RESULTS: The HPLC analysis of MESf revealed the presence of canthin-6-one, kaempferol and morin. Differential in vitro toxicities were observed between MESf and canthin-6-one. In the cytotoxicity assay, MESf presented toxicity against CHO-K1, while canthin-6-one did not. In the case of in vitro genotoxicity, both showed to be potentially genotoxic. In the in vivo toxicity study, both MESf (up to 1000â€¯mg/kg) and cantin-6-one (up to 100â€¯mg/kg) caused no toxicologically relevant alterations and are thus considered not to be toxic. MESf was shown to be relatively safe with NOAEL (100â€¯mg/kg) when administrate in mice. Both MESf and canthin-6-one also showed differential antimicrobial activities. On one hand, MESf demonstrated good spectrum of antibacterial action against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 12.5â€¯mug/mL) and Escherichia coli (MIC 25â€¯mug/mL) and moderate activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Shigella flexneri (MIC 200â€¯mug/mL) but no antifungal effect. On the hand, canthin-6-one showed no antibacterial activity, except against Staphylococcus aureus (100â€¯mug/mL), but potent in vitro fungicidal activity against clinically important Aspergillus niger and Candida species at MFC intervals ranging from 3.12 to 25â€¯mug/mL. Both MESf and canthin-6-one were bacteriostatic in action. MESf antimicrobial mechanism of actions are associated with changes in the permeability of bacterial membranes, evidenced by the increased entry of hydrophobic antibiotic in Shigella flexneri, intense K(+) efflux (Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus) and nucleotides leakage (Staphylococcus aureus). In the antifungal mode of action, canthin-6-one inhibited Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth and including alteration in the cell membrane of Neurospora crassa. CONCLUSION: The results of this work demonstrated the differential antimicrobial activities of MESf and its alkaloid isolate, canthin-6-one with antibacterial and antifungal activities, respectively. The present study support the popular use of Simaba ferruginea in combatting afflictions related to bacterial infections, and demonstrate that canthin-6-one as a promising antifungal agent. Both MESf and canthin-6-one are considered non-toxic based on the in vitro toxicological study.","['Antimicrobial', 'Canthin-6-one', 'Phytochemistry', 'Simaba ferruginea', 'Toxicity']",Journal of ethnopharmacology,Brazil,2018 Sep 15
